Description:
			Four youths have been arrested for allegedly abducting and raping a 17-year-old girl, police said today.

The arrested youths were identified as Shariq Alam (18), Saif Ali (20), Anil Dabar (20) and Sachin Maheshwari (23), Aerodrome Police Station In-charge K L Dangi said.

According to police, the minor girl had gone missing on October 16 and since then her mobile phone was switched-off.

The father of the victim had approached the police and told them that he suspected Shariq Alam of having kidnapped his minor daughter.

"After going through the call data records of the victim as well as Alam, they were traced to a hotel in Ujjain, following which police raided the place on October 18 and rescued the girl," Dangi said.

Alam told the police that he and the victim were studying in the same school.

"On October 16, Alam had asked the girl to come to a place here stating that he wanted to return some objectionable photos and videos to her. However, when she arrived, he forced her to get inside a car along with his friend and took her to Ujjain. To make her unconscious, she was given a sedative following which both of them, along with two others raped her," Dangi said.

While Shariq was arrested on October 18, the remaining three accused were arrested last evening, police said, adding that Shariq and Saif are brothers and had come to Indore from Varanasi to study.
