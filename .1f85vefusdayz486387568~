Murder
Description:
			A 25-year-old woman burned herself alive, along with her two children, at her house in Lahar tehsil today following an altercation with her husband, police said.

"Poonam Kori, a resident of ward No 14 in Dabuh Nagar panchayat, around 50 kms away from here, set herself and her two kids Manav (4) and Ananiya (1) ablaze by dousing herself and them with kerosene after having a heated argument with her husband Kamlesh Kori (30)," SP Vineet Khanna told PTI.

The neighbours broke open the door of Kori's house after they spotted smoke billowing from it, he said, adding that while they found Ananiya dead, Poonam and Manav were writhing in pain.

The duo were rushed to Primary Health Centre in Lahar where they succumbed to their injuries.

Police have booked a case against Kamlesh under section 306 (abetment of suicide) of Indian Penal Code (IPC).

When asked if Poonam killed herself because she was being harassed for dowry by her husband and in-laws, the SP said further investigations are on.
