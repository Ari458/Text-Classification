Murder, Rape
Description:
			The semi-nude body of a 26-year-old woman with several stab wounds was found last night at an under-construction building in North-East Delhi's Mansarovar Park area in a suspected case of sexual assault and murder, police said.

The security guard of the building is the prime suspect in the case as he is missing since the incident was reported.

The incident came to light when police received a call at 12:30 AM last night.

"When a police team reached the spot, a woman's body was found wrapped in a mattress and covered with a tarpaulin which was soaked in blood. Her face was towards the ground and there were no clothes on her lower body. The body bore stab injuries on the neck, thigh, hands and fingers," said a police official.

The deceased was wearing a green shirt. We have recovered the remaining clothes of the woman, three other T-shirts soaked in blood, snacks and 13 beer bottles from the location.

The security guard of the building is missing and a hunt is on for him, he said.

Prima facie it seems that the woman was sexually assaulted before being killed but a clear picture would emerge once the post-mortem examination is done, police said.

Initially, the body was not identified. The woman's mother, who lived somewhere else, had come to meet her in the evening when she found her two children crying at home. She then informed the victim's husband, Salman, who is an auto driver, and they started searching for her and reached the police station.

The deceased's family has claimed that one of her four-year-old son has hinted toward the murder of his mother.

The police have registered a case of murder and destruction of evidence at the Mansarovar Park police station.

"The body has been sent for post-mortem examination to ascertain if she was sexually assaulted or not", aid a senior police official.
