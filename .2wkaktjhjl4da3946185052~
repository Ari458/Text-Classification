Description:
			A 60-year-old Bandra resident was convicted on Tuesday with raping his minor daughter over six years and sentenced to life imprisonment until his natural death.
This is a stigma to society. The accused has committed the shameful act with his daughter. He used to rape her twice a day for six years even when she delivered a child, said special judge Vrushali Joshi, describing the crime as heinous.
According to the Times of India, Joshi convicted the senior citizen under sections 376 (2) (f) (rape committed by a relative, guardian or teacher of, or a person in a position or trust or authority towards the woman) and 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) of the Indian Penal Code.
The convict worked as a liftman in a building and lived on its terrace with his four children the survivor who is now in her late teens, her 12-year-old sister and two older brothers, both in their twenties. Their mother died several years ago.

The Times of India report further added that in her absence, the man began his brutality when his eldest daughter was barely 10 and studying in Class IV. When she protested, her father hit her and threatened her. She had confided in her brothers, but they did not pay heed to her pleas to stop the assault.
There was nobody to disclose such a shameful act of her own father. He did not allow her to go anywhere. He stopped her education and continued to commit the heinous act with his own daughter, Joshi was quoted in the report as having said.
The survivor conceived a child during the sexual assault and delivered a baby girl a year ago.
However, the report said, an incident last year prompted her to take steps. She saw her father brutally assaulting her younger sister with a belt. When she tried to stop him, he threatened her.
The survivor finally confided in her friend about her ordeal and told her that she feared that the same fate awaited her younger sister.
According to the Times of India report, the friend coaxed her to report the matter to the police. In March last year, the survivor registered an First Information Report (FIR)  with the Nirmal Nagar police.

The culprit was consequently arrested and tried.
