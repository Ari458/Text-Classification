Rape
Description:
			A higher secondary student was allegedly gang-raped by six persons at Bihta, about 38 km from here.

Yesterday, the victim was meeting a male friend near a small bridge, when six miscreants overpowered them. They were taken to the bushes at some distance, where the girl was gang-raped by them, police said.

The girl, a resident of Bhojpur district, hails from Mahadalit community (SC) and had come to her relative's house at Bihta to prepare for examinations.

Hearing screams of the girl, a woman picking firewood in the area alerted the villagers, who rushed to the spot and rescued the girl. They also managed to catch one of the fleeing miscreants, identified as Deepak Kumar and handed him over to the police.

Patna Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Jitendra Rana said four out of the six accused in the case have been arrested so far and raids are being conducted to nab the remaining two culprits.

"Two were arrested by the police yesterday itself, while the other two were nabbed today during the early hours.

Our teams are out, conducting raids and we expect the remaining accused to be caught soon," Rana said.

Patna Rural SP Harkishore Rai said the three accused - Bhura Yadav, Ramji Rai and Sonu Kumar - were arrested after the police got leads from Deepak. He added two absconders are Chunchun Kumar and Nanda Kumar and efforts are being made to nab him.

Rana said the medical examination of the victim was conducted at government referral hospital in Bihta yesterday and a few other tests would be carried out at Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) today. Forensic teams of the police were also collecting evidence pertaining to the case.

"The victim and her friend will be produced in court and their statements will be recorded under section 164 of Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC). We will file charge-sheet in the case within two to three days and push for speedy trial of the culprits," the Rural SP Rai said.
