Description:
			A 19-year-old B.Com second year student was beaten to death allegedly by his senior when the former objected to eve-teasing of a girl student at a private college here, police said.

The accused, Satish Kodkar, allegedly hit the victim Harshavardhan Rao twice on his neck and chest after which he fell on the classroom bench and hit his head on the edge of the bench, a senior police officer said.

Kodkar, who is a final-year student, is absconding since the incident, they said.

"Kodkar hit twice on Rao's neck and chest, after which he fell down even as his head hit an iron rod on the edge of a bench," Assistant Commissioner of Police (Sultan Bazar Division) Ravula Giridhar said.

"Rao became unconscious and was shifted to a nearby hospital where he died while undergoing treatment," he said.

A murder case has been registered with Sultan Bazar Police Station against Satish. Police is on the hunt to nab the accused, he said adding that the matter is under investigation.

An autopsy was conducted on the teenager's body and it has been handed over to his family members today, he said.

Kodkar had allegedly teased a girl who was Rao's friend, and objected to the act.

"A scuffle broke out during lunch hour yesterday, when Kodkar went inside Rao's classroom and argued with him over the matter before hitting him," the ACP said.

Sultan Bazar Police Station Inspector G Srinivas ruled out that the incident was a fallout of ragging.
