Child Sexual Abuse, Murder, Rape
Description:
			A 24-year-old man was today awarded death sentence by a court for the rape and murder of a minor girl here in 2010.

Parkash Zinak Nishad alias Kewat, a resident of Bhayander, a Mumbai suburb, was pronounced guilty by Thane Additional Sessions Judge S J Kale.

The Judge awarded death sentence to Nishad under IPC Section 302 (murder), holding the case as the "rarest of the rare" and also varying jail terms, including life sentence, for other offences related to the case like rape and causing disappearance of evidence.

Additional Public Prosecutor Sanjay Lodhe said the six -year-old victim and the convict, who is married, were neighbours.

On June 11, 2010 when the girl was playing outside her residence after dinner, Nishad picked her up and took to his house where he sexually assaulted the minor. He subsequently murdered the girl and dumped her body in a `nullah' where it was spotted the next morning, the court was told.

The accused was arrested while he was planning to flee from the locality.

The prosecution examined 13 witnesses, including the parents of the girl. The court accepted the submissions made by the prosecution like medical and DNA reports and also relied on circumstantial and other evidence before arriving at the guilty verdict.
