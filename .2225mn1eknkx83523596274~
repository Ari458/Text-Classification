Murder
Description:
			A man allegedly murdered his three minor children, including two girls, before attempting suicide in Nalgonda district of Telangana today, police said.

The incident took place in Veluvarthi village of Valigonda police station limits of the district.

The accused Ramesh, a private employee, initially gave his two daughters aged seven and eight and his three-and-half-year-old son, soft drinks laced with rat poison and later strangled all of them with a cloth, a senior police officer said.

"Initially, the accused made his children drink soft drink mixed with rat poison. When they fell unconscious, he strangled them before attempting suicide by getting himself electrocuted," DSP Mohan Reddy told PTI over phone.

According to preliminary investigation, Ramesh's wife had deserted him over family disputes and he bore a grudge against her and hence killed his children, the senior police officer said.

A case of murder has been registered against the accused and he was subsequently arrested, the DSP said.
