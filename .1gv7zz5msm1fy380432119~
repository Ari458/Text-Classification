Description:
			Condemning the incident in Rajasthan where a woman was allegedly paraded half-naked, Uttar Pradesh minister Mohammad Azam Khan today said Chief Minister Vasundhare Raje should quit the post if she being a woman cannot extend security to women in her state.

"It is unfortunate that such an incident has taken place in Rajasthan which has a lady chief minister. What right does she have to continue in office if she is not able to extend security to women?" he asked.

"I want to know what the BJP thinks about the incident as none of their leaders have commented on it," he added.

A 40-year-old woman was allegedly paraded half-naked on a donkey by some Panchayat members in Rajsamand district on the suspicion of being involved in a murder case on Saturday.

A case was registered against 39 people in the matter following a complaint filed by the victim's husband on Sunday.

Claiming that the crime was being kept in control in an "effective manner" in Uttar Pradesh, Azam said BJP-led state government should take lessons from the state.

Accusing the BJP of magnifying every incident in UP to create a stir, Khan said the crime graph in BJP-ruled states has gone up and yet their leaders continue to remain silent.
