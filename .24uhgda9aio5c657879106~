Human Trafficking, Rape
Description:
			A local court has awarded 10 -year jail term to a man for raping a 21-year-old woman here last year.

The sentence was awarded yesterday by First Additional Sessions Judge A K Verma, who also handed down seven-year prison sentence to a woman who kept the victim captive at her residence and later forced her into flesh trade, prosecution said today.

The court imposed a fine of Rs 10,000 each on the two convicts - the man, identified only as Shenshah, and the woman, Rajabeti, it said.

Shenshah was caught with the victim at a house which was raided by the police on August 17, 2013 on receiving a tip-off about flesh trade racket.

The victim told the police she hails from Assam and one Vicky had brought her to Delhi with a promise to marry her. He, however, later sold her to another man, Raju.

Raju then brought the victim to Morena and handed over to Rajabeti, who forced her into flesh trade.

After hearing the victim's ordeal, police arrested Rajabeti and booked under relevant sections of the IPC and Immoral Trafficking (Prevention) Act, the prosecution said.

Acting on a statement given by the survivor, police registered a case of rape against Shenshah and secured his conviction, it added.
