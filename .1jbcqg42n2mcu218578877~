Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A complaint was filed against a youth accusing him of raping a girl and then threatening her, police said.

The 17-year-old girl was raped by her cousin Deepak alias Kallu when she alone at home a few days ago. He had come to her residence and given her a glass of water laced with sedatives after drinking which she lost consciousness, police said.

When she came to her senses, she realised that she had been sexually assaulted. Her parents did not file a police complaint at the time of the incident because of her impending marriage plans.

A month later, the accused came to her house in an inebriated condition and threatened to kill her unless she stayed with him, they said.

Following the incident the girl is in a state of shock, police said, adding, a case has been registered under section 376 (rape) and the investigations are underway.
