Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			The sessions court here today sentenced a 21-year-old youth to ten years' imprisonment for raping a minor girl.

According to suburban Shivaji Nagar police, the grandmother of the victim had approached the police on July 20 last year saying that the accused sexually assaulted the girl when she had gone to her parents' house.

The girl, who was then ten years old, lived with her grandmother and visited her parents occasionally.

Public Prosecutor Sheela Jamdar examined five witnesses most of whom turned hostile, including the old lady.

The victim herself remained mostly silent when questions were put to her. However judge C A Nathani relied on medical reports and the girl's statement before the magistrate to convict the accused.

In another case, judge Nathani sentenced a 40-year-old man to three years' imprisonment on the charge of molestation.

According to the prosecution, one of the three victims in the case told her mother that the accused undressed before them, following which a case of molestation was filed.

One of the victims was a friend of the accused's daughter.
