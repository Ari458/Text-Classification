Child Sexual Abuse, Human Trafficking, Rape
Description:
			Parents of the 14-year-old girl from a Jharkhand village who was trafficked, raped in Delhi and dumped in Gurgaon said she went to school about a month ago and did not return.

Her parents said they did not approach the police at that time, fearing the wrath of a few local criminals who were into human trafficking. 

The girl was a class 7 student in a small government-aided school in her nondescript Gumla village, said her father, a farmer. The Gumla admitted the teenager went missing from school.

Our investigation suggests she went missing from school. Our team will leave for Delhi to bring her back, said Gumla superintendent of police, Bheemsen T.

The officer in-charge of the police station concerned that the police questioned the school authorities.  

The girl who was rescued from the MG Road metro station on Sunday late night by Gurgaon police and NGO Shakti Vahini in a joint operation, disclosed that she was placed at a household in Delhi where she first time met Sanju, an auto driver who stayed in the neighbourhood.

She said that on Saturday Sanju lured her out of the house, promising a good time outside. Sanju took her to a secluded place, raped her and later dumped her near a metro station, she said.

The girl told the Gurgaon CWC that she was taken to Delhi by a woman, possibly a trafficking agent, who provides jobs to minors in the village. She, however, could not name the woman.

The teenager could not narrate how she went missing from school and eventually landed in Delhi. She said she was yet to be paid by her employers.

While medical report confirms rape, the Gurgaon police said she had had sexual intercourse several times in the past. This raised speculation of her being sexually exploited by her employers and placement agents.
