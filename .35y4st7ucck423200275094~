Rape
Description:
			A 40-year-old woman was allegedly gang-raped in Basirhat on Saturday night, within a few hours after the by-election to the Basirhat Dakshin assembly seat was held.

BJP claimed that Trinamool Congress activists gang-raped the woman to take revenge as her family members were their supporters. Trinamool Congress has denied the charge.

All the three accused were arrested and a medical test was conducted on the survivor.

The woman was alone in her home in Sardarhati, Basirhat, on Saturday night when the three allegedly barged in around 11pm.

The woman said that the miscreants flashed a chopper and threatened to kill her if she dared to raise an alarm. The three then allegedly took turns in raping her. Before leaving, they warned her of dire consequences if she told about the incident to anyone.

The victim's husband, a vegetable vendor, and their son came home within a few hours. Seeing her husband, she broke down and narrated the incident. Then they went to Basirhat police station and lodged a complaint.

The woman told police that she was able to recognize one of the miscreants as Pukai Mondal, who was from her locality.

"Pukai was arrested immediately after the FIR was lodged and the other two  Reazul Mondal and Shamsher Ali Sardar were held upon interrogating Pukai," said Bhaskar Mukherjee, additional police superintendent of Barasat.

"The woman's family members are supporters of the BJP. She was subjected to the heinous crime by supporters of the ruling party only to teach them a lesson for supporting our party," said Samik Bhattacharya, who was the BJP candidate from Basirhat Dakshin in the bypoll. The party has decided to stand by the woman and approach all authorities concerned so that the accused are punished.

Trinamool Congress, however, refuted the charges and said that the party had nothing to do with the gang-rape. "I have heard about the gang. Police have been told to take strict action. But the incident had nothing to do with our party. The allegations are baseless and are only meant to tarnish the image of the party," said Jyotipriya Mallick of Trinamool Congress.

Pukai has been remanded in five days' police custody after he was produced in court on Sunday. Reazul and Shamsher Ali will be produced in court on Monday.
