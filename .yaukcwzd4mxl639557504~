Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			Parents of a four-year-old have lodged an FIR against her maternal grandfather alleging the 57-year-old man abused her sexually. Father of the girl approached Chowk police on September 13 to lodge a complaint against his father-in-law but was turned out. The child's father is an architect and alleged that the incident took place at Begumganj locality.

He then approached senior superintendent of police who ordered an FIR be registered in the case. On Thursday, police registered a case under IPC section 377 (unnatural sex) among other charges. To back his claim, the girl child's father had submitted medical report to the police mentioning injuries in private parts. Since the check up took place in a private hospital, police sent the girl to Balrampur hospital for conclusive medical examination.

Father of the victim said "for the last several days, we have been pleading to the police to register a complaint against my in-laws for physically abusing and assaulting my daughter, but police locked me behind bars on a forged complaint of my father-in-law, who alleged that I threaten to kill him."

In charge of Chowk police station, inspector I P Singh said that charges were being probed. "The family is locked in a property battle as well. I have asked the girl's father to give me names of the policemen who refused to entertain his complaint initially," he said.
