Rape
Description:
			A young woman has accused her husband and two of his friends of abducting and gang-raping her in a moving car and then dumping her in an unconscious state in east Delhi last evening.

Police have registered an FIR in this regard following the victim's complaint and a manhunt has been launched for the trio who are the run.

The victim, who claims to be 22 years old while her marriage certificate puts her age to be 26, had a love marriage with her husband around a year ago.

"They were neighbours and lived in east Delhi's Ram Nagar.

However, things fell apart soon after the marriage and she started living separately in Shahdara area within one month of the wedding. The woman had even filed for divorce," said a police official.

The woman in her statement has told police that her husband and two of her friends had abducted her in a car last evening when she was returning after shopping from a mall in Anand Vihar.

"The trio took turns to rape her in a moving car and even inserted candles in her private part. Her husband taunted her during the act saying that she was being punished for entangling him and his family in legal tangles," said a police official quoting the victim's complaint.

They then dumped her at an isolated spot and fled. The woman after regaining consciousness contacted her family members who then took her to Anand Vihar police station.

She was sent for a medical examination and treatment at Dr Hedgewar Hospital and an FIR has been registered.

"The woman had also filed a case against her husband and his family in Ghaziabad's Vijay Vihar area in March this year accusing them of kidnapping and attempt to murder," the officer said, adding that further investigations are underway.
