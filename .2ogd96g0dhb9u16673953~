Rape
Description:
			A 19-year-old girl was allegedly raped by a 34-year-old man last week. The accused has been identified as Suresh Dodiya, a resident of Champaknagar on Morbi Road.

According to the police complaint, Dodiya took the girl to Madhya Pradesh and raped her repeatedly. Dodiya, who is a photographer and runs a studio, has been arrested by the women police of Rajkot.

The rape survivor told the police that she has been Dodiya's neighbour for last three years. She came to know Dodiya after his daughter came to her house to play with her.

After some time, Dodiya, who is a father two children, started calling on her mobile phone and both fell in love with each other. On August 22, Dodiya called her asking her to meet him on Kuvadava Road urgently. She went there to meet him.

"He then asked me to come with him and marry him. I told him that I do not have any belongings with me. But he forced me to go with him. He took me to Ratlam and Javra in Madhya Pradesh where he raped me,'' she alleges.

She said that they returned to Rajkot on August 25 and he threatened her to kill her if she told anyone about the incident. But she later informed this to her family members and registered a case against Dodiya at the women police station.
