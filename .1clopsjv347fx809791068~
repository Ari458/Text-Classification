Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			In the last couple of days, a three-year-old girl was allegedly raped by the son of the owner of a play school which she attended in West Delhi's Hari Nagar area.

The incident came to light yesterday afternoon when the girl returned home unwell and complained of pain in her private parts.

When her family took her to a private hospital, it was revealed that she was bleeding and had been sexually assaulted.

The family then approached Hari Nagar Police Station in the evening and registered a case in this connection.

Things turned ugly here this morning when a group of protesters including the girl's family and locals reached the playschool and roughed up the accused.

"Our team rushed to the spot and saved the 24-year-old accused, identified as Vikas from the angry crowd. He has been arrested under sections of 376 IPC and sections of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO)," said Additional Commissioner of Police (West) Ranveer Singh.

The girl in her statement to police and people from the NGO who counseled her that Vikas, whom she referred as 'bhayya' touched her inappropriately after luring her into toilets and vacant rooms on the pretext of providing her chocolates.

Police is probing whether the accused abused other children of the playschool as well. The CCTV footage of the centre, which runs pre-school classes for children below five years of age, is being examined.

The victim's family claimed that the girl had been ill since the last three days. She was brought home and is undergoing treatment.

The incident came as a shock for locals who considered the playschool to be safe for children. A number of parents had also gathered at the spot to protest worrying about their child's safety.

The horrific incident came close to the heels of Wednesday's incident where a playschool attendant was arrested for allegedly molesting a two-and-a-half-year-old in outer Delhi's Rohini area.
