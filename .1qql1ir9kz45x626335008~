Description:
			A 26-year-old man was today arrested for allegedly attacking a woman with acid after she declined his marriage proposal in Adilabad district of Telangana.

Mohd Muneem, who works at a private company here, was in a relationship for the past five years with the 24-year-old woman but she kept postponing his marriage proposal, Nirmal town police station Inspector Prashant Reddy said.

Apparently upset over the victim's refusal to marry him, Muneem got into an argument with the woman today following which he poured acid on her head, Reddy said.

"Both of them had an argument over the marriage proposal after she declined it saying her parents were against the marriage. After this, Muneem took out a bottle containing acid and suddenly poured it on her head," he said.

The woman was immediately rushed to a nearby hospital and has reportedly suffered minor injuries, Reddy told PTI over phone.

However, police has registered a case under section 307 (attempt to murder), 506 (intimidation) and 326-A (dealing exclusively with acid attack incidents) of IPC against Muneem, the Inspector said.
