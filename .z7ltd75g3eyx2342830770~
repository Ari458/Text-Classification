Human Trafficking, Murder, Rape
Description:
			One more person was arrested today in connection with the case wherein a 25-year-old migrant woman was allegedly gang-raped and sold to a man while her three-year-old child was strangulated to death here, police said.

The accused has been identified as Dayachand, a resident of Bhagana village of Alwar district in Rajasthan, a state police department spokesman said.

He had allegedly acted as a middleman in selling the woman, he said.

The spokesman said the woman had reached Rewari railway station from Maharashtra a few days ago in search of work. She met truck driver Mukesh, a resident of Kheejuri village, who took her to his house.

After some days Mukesh went out of station and his brother Satish came to live there.

On the night of December 10, Satish called his friends Jaipal and Hawa Singh, residents of Kheejuri, and they consumed liquor, he said.

Thereafter, they allegedly gang-raped the woman and strangled her 3-year-old son to death.

The trio then allegedly sold the woman for Rs 40,000 to a person in Rajasthan through Surajbhan, a resident of Nangal Sehbaazpur, he said.

The crime came to light when the police recovered the body of the child and later traced the victim in Rajasthan.

Her medical examination has confirmed that she was gangraped, he said.

Five accused Satish Kumar, Jaipal, Hawa Singh, Suraj Bhan Saini and Sandeep were arrested yesterday.

All the accused were presented before a court today.

Satish, Hawa Singh and Jaipal had allegedly killed the child and gangraped the woman; Sandeep, a resident of Nangli Maataur village in Alwar district of Rajasthan, is the alleged buyer of the woman, and Surajbhan and Dayachand allegedly acted as middlemen, the spokesman said.

The court sent Sandeep, Dayachand and Surajbhan to 14-day judicial custody while Satish, Jaipal and Hawa Singh were remanded to police custody for three days, he said.

The woman has been sent to 'Nari Niketan' at Karnal, police said.
