Murder
Description:
			A Mahila court here today sentenced a man to 11 years of rigorous imprisonment on the charge of abetting the suicide of his wife five years ago over dowry demand.

The prosecution case was that Mangaleswari, wife of G Murugesan, working in a grinder manufacturing unit here, was dejected as her husband was pestering her for five sovereigns of gold more, despite her family giving 10 sovereigns at the time of marriage.

Unable to bear the tantrums of Murugesan, Mangaleswari went and stayed with her parents at Paramakudi for some time but returned after her husband promnised not to trouble her in future. But as he started troubling her again, she committed suicide by setting herself ablaze on December 22, 2009.

Based on the complaint, Murugesan was arrested but was granted bail and the case was going on in the Mahila court.

Mahila Court Judge M P Subramaniam sentenced Murugesan to undergo 11 years imprisonment for abetting the suicide.
