Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A 13-year-old girl was allegedly raped by her father and uncle here for over a month, police said today.

Based on the girl's complaint, the two accused were arrested yesterday, Aerodrome police station in-charge K L Dangi said.

The girl's father and maternal uncle had allegedly been sexually assaulting her for the last one-and-a-half month, Dangi said quoting a complaint filed yesterday by the victim in this connection.

The girl, a student of class VII, had been living with her father at Kalani Nagar here as her mother had separated from him some years back.

The two accused threatened her with dire consequences if she revealed about the incident to anybody, he said.

However, unable to bear the agony, the girl confided in her neighbours.

Later, with the help of her neighbours and a social organisation - Child Line - the girl managed to file a police complaint against the two men following which they were nabbed, he said.

The accused have been booked under IPC sections 376 (rape) and 506 (criminal intimidation) and other relevant sections, the police officer added.
