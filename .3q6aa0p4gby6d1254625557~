Rape
Description:
			A 24-year-old Delhi University student has accused a youth of allegedly raping her on the pretext of marriage in south-east Delhi's Govindpuri area.

The 25-year-old accused, who lives in a rented accommodation in the Kapashedra border area, has been detained for questioning by police. He is currently unemployed while the girl is a student at a Delhi University women's college.

According to the girl's statement, she came into contact with the youth in 2013. He used to visit his relative who lived in another flat in the same building in the Tughlakabad Extension area of Govindpuri where the girl resided with her family.

"Both of them hail from Kerala and they became friends.

The friendship soon turned into an affair and they started meeting frequently. In October 2013, the accused took the girl to his place where he allegedly established physical relationship with her and repeated the act in February 2014 at his friend's house," police said citing the girl's statement.

The girl claimed that the youth promised to marry her and had even taken money and jewellery from her on that pretext.

However, feeling that the youth was in no mood to keep his promise, the girl approached Govindpuri police and filed a complaint against him of rape.
