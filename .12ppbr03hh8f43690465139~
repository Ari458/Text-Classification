Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A 25-year-old man, Sanjay Sharma, was arrested by the Charkop police on Tuesday on charges of raping a minor. The girl's parents learnt that she was raped after they found her to be five months pregnant.

The girl (14), a Kandivli resident, is a Class VII student and knew Sharma. The accused resides in the same locality and works at a box-making factory. "Sharma reportedly had physical relations with the girl at her house between November 2013 and September 2014 after promising to marry her. Recently, when the girl complained of stomach ache, her parents took her to a hospital, where doctors told them she was pregnant," the police said. A case of rape was registered on September 11 but Sharma was arrested on Tuesday as he was absconding.
