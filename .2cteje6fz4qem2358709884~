Rape
Description:
			A woman booked under MCOCA by Delhi Police has alleged she was gang-raped by four men in Hauz Khas on Friday night.

The woman had been in Tihar Jail for the last few years but is out on parole. Police have registered an FIR for assault, rape and criminal intimidation. The woman said she was at home when a person named Bobby called her outside. Bobby is known to her so she went out and sat in his car, she claimed. Three others whom she identified as Rajan, Bittoo and Azad were also in the car, the FIR by her reads.

The trio raped her inside the moving car even as Bobby held a pistol to her head, she alleged. They then dropped her near her house and fled after threatening her with dire consequences, she alleged. She has been sent for medical examination.

Sources said there are several inconsistencies in the woman's complaint but that police would only issue a statement after the investigation is over. The victim has also expressed threat to her life.
