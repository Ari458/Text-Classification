Murder
Description:
			A woman was today allegedly murdered by her neighbour in Rajiv Colony area.

Suresh, the accused, strangulated the victim early this morning, police said. They had frequent quarrels and she had hired people to have him beaten up on two occasions, police added.

"After murdering her, Suresh and another man called Nagendra were taking the body on a bike to dispose it of, but police caught them during a vehicle-checking," inspector K Srinivas said.

"The duo tried to escape, but the bike skidded, and they fell to the ground with the body."

The victim was into prostitution which was the reason of her quarrels with the accused, police said, while denying that she was sexually assaulted before the murder.

"Last night Suresh apparently offered her money to have a sexual intercourse with him. After she went to his house, he allegedly strangulated her," the inspector said.

Further probe is on.
