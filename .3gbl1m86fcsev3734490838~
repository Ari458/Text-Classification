Murder
Description:
			Unidentified assailants killed two women of a family by slitting their throats in Sitamarhi district.

The two women identified as Sumitra Devi (60) and Kamla Devi (50) were killed last night near Virta Tola area of the district, the police said.

Sitamarhi Sadar Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) M N Upadhyaya said the women were returning to their home at Virta Tola after visiting their widowed daughter-in-law at Mohanpur-Baswariya village near Sitamarhi town.

"They were returning home with their grandsons. It seems unidentified miscreants overpowered them and slit their throats at deserted place before they could reach home. The grandsons are also traceless. Their belt and slippers have been found on the murder spot," Upadhyaya said.

The DSP said dog squad has been called to trace the grandsons. Police teams have been sent to trace the dead women's daughter-in-law too, as she has also vanished.

"There is definitely some foul play. It could be domestic dispute too. We have launched investigations in the case. The dead bodies have been sent for postmortem," Upadhyaya said.
