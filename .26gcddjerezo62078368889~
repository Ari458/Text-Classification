Murder
Description:
			A middle-aged man, who suspected his wife of having an illicit affair with the nephew of their landlord, killed the duo in North-East Delhi's Gokulpuri area.

The accused, identified as Arun Chauhan, a taxi driver, has been arrested by the police.

Last night the couple had a heated argument. "Both of them went to bed normally. However, Chauhan woke up in night and smothered his wife Kavita (36) to death using the pillow," said a police officer.

In the morning, he told his children that he has killed their mother and that he too will now go to jail. He told his daughter that she should take care of her brother and take him to school and tuitions regularly in his absence.

His daughter then informed her uncle who then called up the police.

Meanwhile, Chauhan called up Akash who was the nephew of his landlord around 7:30 AM on the pretext that his son had gone missing and he wanted his help to find him.

"As Akash reached his home, Chauhan took him to the Ganda Nala nearby where he stabbed him over 11 times with a knife until he collapsed on the ground. He then fled from the crime scene," the official added.

The police, which had by that time reached Chauhan's house and was busy with investigation learnt about a body being found at Ganda Nala.

When it emerged that Akash had a connection with Chauhan and his wife, police realised that the murder has been committed by the same person.

"We then tracked Chauhan through technical surveillance and arrested him. He has confessed to have committed the crime and claimed that he suspected his wife to be involved with Akash," he added.
