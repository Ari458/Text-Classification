Crime, Rape
Description:
			A welder and a bike mechanic were today arrested for allegedly gang-raping a 21-year-old student at an isolated place off the Outer Ring Road at Hayathnagar here.

Accused Srinivas Reddy, welder, and Linga Reddy, mechanic, took photographs of the girl along with her classmate when they were together at a secluded place and later started blackmailing the girl, saying they will expose her before her parents, a senior police officer said.

"The duo had blackmailed the victim that they will show her photographs taken along with her companion (classmate) to her parents and gang-raped her on Monday," Deputy Commissioner of Police (L B Nagar Zone) C Ravi Varma said.

After a complaint by the girl student, a case was registered yesterday and both of them were today arrested.

Hayathnagar Police Station Inspector P Venkateshwarlu said they had registered a case of gang-rape under relevant sections of IPC. Probe is on.
