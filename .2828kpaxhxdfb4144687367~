Rape
Description:
			Police arrested a constable on charges of raping a female associate. Accused Mukut Bihari Meena, posted in Udaimandir police station, has alleged to have raped the female constable on the pretext of marriage.

According to the police, the female constable is posted at the Reserve Police in Jodhpur. In her complaint, she alleged that both of them were neighbours at the government quarters in the police line itself. "Being neighbours, a courtesy communication started between the two which gradually transformed into a friendship," she said in her complaint.

She alleged that the relationship turned physical after the accused assured of marrying her. "Later, when I insisted on marriage, he started dilly-dallying the matter and started avoiding me," she said.

According to the police, when she insisted further, the accused started threatening her with charges of defaming her. "On Saturday, she visited his quarters to talk to him but he again threatened her and raped her," police informed.

After the incident, she complained to the police against Meena. "We registered the case and arrested Meena on Monday night," police said. Police also got the medical examination of the woman on Tuesday.

According to the police, a similar case is already pending against Meena, wherein he had married a constable some time back but deserted her after a couple of months.
