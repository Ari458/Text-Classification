Description:
			Two persons have been arrested for allegedly kidnapping and selling a child.

Gulzar Singh (33) and Surender Kaur (37) were arrested from near Janakpuri Metro station in Delhi.

Gulzar and Surender, along with another accomplice Neetu Kaur, kidnapped a one-year-old boy from Delhi Cantoment railway station on April 1 and sold him to the childless landlord of Surender and Neetu for Rs 50,000, a senior police officer said.

They had assured the landlord that the child was Gulzar's brother's, which he even gave in writing, the officer said, adding, the trio had also drugged the 5-year-old sister of the kidnapped boy.

The women lured the girl into talk and took her along with the boy near Chokhandi temple in Tilak Nagar and then asked the girl to leave. When the girl refused to leave without her brother, they laced her food with 'Alprax', and after she became unconscious, they left her near Delhi Cantonment Railway Station and fled with the boy, the officer said.

Surender's landlords in Khayala were childless. They had tried to adopt a child but it didn't materialise. Surender plotted with Gulzari to arrange a child and sell it to the landlord, he said.

The baby boy has been retrieved and handed over to his parents. A case has been registered against the accused and further investigation is on, and a hunt is on to arrest the third accused.

Surender Kaur has also been found to have been previously involved in cases of kidnapping at Sadar Police Station, Alwar, the officer added.
