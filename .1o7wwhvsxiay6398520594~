Rape, Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			A 25-year-old student of a government college has accused a visually-impaired professor of repeatedly raping her over a period of more than a year.

In a complaint filed yesterday at Cheheratha police station here, the girl has alleged that 51-year-old Varinder Singh, who is a professor of music at the college, had been repeatedly raping her since last one-and-a-half years.

The girl has claimed that she used to go to Singh's house after college to learn music from him.

She has alleged that Singh one day offered her cold drink laced with intoxicants and raped her after she fell unconscious. She further claimed that he made a video of the act, police said.

Police said they were verifying the girl's claims as Singh's wife is said to be around the visually-impaired professor at all times.
