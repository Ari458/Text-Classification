Murder
Description:
			In a suspected case of honour killing, a 21-year-old girl was allegedly murdered here by her parents who opposed her marriage to a youth belonging to a different caste.

The deceased, identified as Bhawna Yadav, a final year student of Sanskrit Honours at Venkateswara College here, was allegedly strangled to death by her parents Jagmohan Yadav, a property dealer and his wife Savitri, on Saturday night at their house in Bharat Vihar, Kakrola in South West Delhi, police said.

"They took her body to Alwar, Rajasthan, were they burnt it at their ancestral village. We have arrested the parents and further investigations are underway," said Deputy Commissioner of Police (South-West) Suman Goyal.

Bhawna and Abhishek Seth (24), who is a government official, had met each other at Venkateswara College in August 2012 through a common friend. They fell in love and wanted to marry each other but knew that their parents won't approve of their relationship, police said.

The young couple, however, got married on November 12 at the Arya Samaj Mandir at Mandir Marg here.

Abhishek then took Bhawna to his home in Uttam Nagar in West Delhi where his parents accepted their marriage, they said.

According to Abhishek, Bhawna's parents reached his home that very night and said that they would get them married in a grand function and took their daughter with them.

"However, once they returned home, they told Bhawna that they don't accept this marriage and they would get her married as per their wish. Bhawna then returned to my place on November 14. Her parents again visited our house with some neighbours and assured that they would do a 'chunni ceremony' (engagement ceremony) at their home and send my wife back on Sunday," said Abhishek.

However, on Saturday night, Abhishek got a call from Bhawna's maternal uncle Lakhan who allegedly threatened to kill both of them.
