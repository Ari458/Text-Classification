Description:
			A 30-year-old woman was killed and her two children were critically injured in Umarvada here when a man along with two of his accomplices, hurled acid on them.

The incident took place last night after the woman rejected sexual advances of accused Aslam Sheikh, following which Sheikh along with his friends barged into the victim's house and threw acid on her and her children, Assistant Commissioner of Police Naresh Kanzariya said.

The victim, identified as Hemu Rathod, was declared dead at a government-run hospital, while her two children Raj (19) and Prem (9) sustained critical burn injuries, he said.

Sheikh and his two aides were arrested today for killing Rathod, he said.

"The police today arrested Aslam Sheikh along with two others Raja Vimalnarayan Shekhar and Sarfaraz Sheikh for throwing acid on the lady and her family at her residence in Koili Khadi locality," Kanzariya said.

Her husband Ramu Rathod (30) and her mother-in-law Kaushalya Rathod (48) received minor injuries in the acid attack, the ACP said.

As per the statement recorded by Hemu's husband, Asalm was harassing his wife for some time now and used to demand sexual favours from her, he said.

Ramu had complained about Aslam's actions to latter's father Salim Sheikh. Annoyed, the accused took this step, Kanzariya said.
