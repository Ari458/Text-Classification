Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			A self-styled Godman was today arrested on charges of attempt to rape, intrusion and sexual harassment of a married woman at Mahanadi Vihar area of the city here, police said.

"42-year-old Sachitra Parida of Kaibalya Ashram in Chandikhol of Jajpur district has been booked under Sections 341, 448, 354-A, 354-B, 376 (2) (f) and 506 of IPC," Mahila police station Inspector Sujata Jena said.

Parida was later taken to jail custody.

Jena said the child-less woman, married for over four years, had met Parida at his Ashram along with her husband several times seeking his blessings for an issue.

However, being suspicious of Parida's motive after he insisted to have physical relations with her, the woman stopped visiting him for past several days, Jena said.

"On Friday, Parida called up the woman and told her to get ready for a puja on Saturday at her home. He also warned if the puja did not take place her husband would die soon," Jena said adding that the woman then consented for the puja.

On arrival at her place this afternoon when her husband was away for work, Parida attempted to rape the woman, Jena said.

As she raised an alarm, she was rescued by neighbours who beat up Parida.

He was later handed over to police by the woman's husband and brother, who arrived on getting the news from neighbours.
