Molestation, Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			A professor of psychology department in Sardar Patel University has been booked for sexually harassing a female assistant professor.
The victim working with a college affiliated to SPU, has lodged a complaint against L R Yagnik yesterday for sexually harassing her at work place.
While the police has registered the complaint under section 354 of the Indian Penal Code and other sections of the Prevention of Atrocities Act, 1989, it is for the first time in the history of SPU that such an incident has happened.
The victim also alleged that she had approached the SPU officials earlier this year with her complaint against the professor but no strict action was taken.
Infact, the accused was allowed to opt for voluntary retirement as per his wish instead of giving him any strict punishment.
The women cell of Sardar Patel University, who were investigating the victims case also recommended strict action against Yagnik but the SPU official were soft on him as he was on the verge of retirement.
The complaint was lodged just a day before Yagniks voluntary retirement.
The victim also met the state chief minister, Anandiben Patel, after which the state education department asked the university to take action in the case based on 'The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act 2013'.
