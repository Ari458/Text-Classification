Murder, Dowry Harassment
Description:
			A couple were convicted while their son was acquitted by a local court in connection with murder of his wife for dowry last year.

District judge Vijay Laxmi held the woman's in-laws guilty on the basis of the victim's dying declaration and reserved the order till December 5 on the quantum of sentence.

The husband of the deceased was acquitted due to lack of evidence.

According to prosecution, Shama Perveen, wife of Shehzad, was burnt to death by her in-laws for failing to fulfil their dowry demands at Miranpur town in the district on December 4 last year. Shama later succumbed to her injuries in the hospital.

Police had registered a case against her husband Shehzad, father-in-law Zulfikar and mother-in-law Munija Begum and the three were arrested.

The sub-divisional magistrate had recorded the dying declaration of Shama in which she had accused her in-laws.

Though all eye witnesses had turned hostile during the trial, yet the court yesterday found the two guilty on the basis of victim's dying declaration.
