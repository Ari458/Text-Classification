Abduction
Description:
			Two men who allegedly tried to kidnap a working woman from Aurobindo Marg near AIIMS in South Delhi last evening have been arrested.

The two accused, identified as Sandeep Yadav (26) and Babloo Sharma (22), both residents of Faridabad, were nabbed from their hideouts by personnel of Hauz Khas police station within hours of the incident, police said today.

Police received a PCR call around 8.55 PM that a woman had been pushed off a white car on Aurobindo Marg near AIIMS Gate No. 1. When local police reached the spot, it found that she had been taken to Trauma Centre of AIIMS by a PCR van.

The victim had sustained minor injuries. Her statement was recorded, which revealed that she is married, has two children and has been staying in a rented house in Badarpur area for the last four years.

"The victim alleged that she has known Sandeep Yadav for the past five years. Sandeep had taken Rs 7 lakh from her on different occasions on one pretext or other. Later, he had returned Rs 4 lakh but refused to pay the remaining amount.

Thereafter, he started threatening and chasing her," said Deputy Commissioner of Police (South) Prem Nath.

Around 8 PM yesterday when she was on way to her house from office in an autorickshaw, she noticed that Sandeep, along with a person, was chasing her in a car.

He tried to stop the autorickshaw but the driver did not stop and kept on driving. When the auto reached Aurobindo Marg, near AIIMS gate, Sandeep Yadav intercepted it, came out of his car and dragged her out of the auto and forcibly tried to make her sit in the car.

When the victim raised alarm, she was thrown out of the moving car and the duo escaped from the spot.
