Murder
Description:
			Police is investigating the role of other relatives of a 21-year-old girl who was allegedly murdered here by her parents as they were against her marriage with a youth from a different caste.

Bhawna Yadav's maternal uncle Lakhan, who had allegedly threatened to kill her husband Abhishek over the phone on Saturday night before she was strangled to death, is being quizzed in this connection.

"He had been showing ignorance about the incident. He had called Abhishek on Saturday night to threaten him. Bhawna had later called her husband asking him to ignore the threat as her uncle was drunk. He had joined investigation this morning and we are probing his role in the case," said a police official.

Bhawna's younger brother, a class 12 student, is also being questioned with the help of an NGO as he is said to have been present in the house when his sister was killed.

His version will be crucial for police probe as it does not have a postmortem report of the girl because she was hurriedly cremated by her parents at their native place in Alwar, they said.

Bhawna Yadav, a final year student of Sanskrit Honours at Venkateswara College here, was allegedly strangled to death by her parents Jagmohan Yadav, a property dealer and his wife Savitri, on Saturday night at their house in Bharat Vihar, Kakrola in South West Delhi, police said.

Bhawna and Abhishek Seth (24), who is a government official had got married on November 12 at the Arya Samaj Mandir at Mandir Marg here.

The victim's parents had taken her to their house, saying that they would formally solemnise their wedding but instead allegedly killed her on Saturday and took the body to Alwar, Rajasthan were they burnt it.
