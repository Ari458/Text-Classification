Rape
Description:
			A 35-year-old woman, who was stranded at the Dalkhola station in North Dinajpur, was allegedly gang-raped by four railway employees on Monday night. The GRP refused to take down her complaint and she was forced to travel 16 km to Karandighi to lodge an FIR with police.

She was sent to hospital where tests confirmed rape, the police said. Nobody was arrested till Wednesday night and the woman is still in hospital.

The woman is a resident of Karandighi in North Dinajpur. She had travelled to a relative's house in Farakka. While returning home, she reached Dalkhola late on Monday evening. At that hour, there was nothing to take her to Karandighi and she decided to spend the night on the platform. According to sources, she was approached by Brajgopal Yadav, a TTE, and offered a place to spend the night.

"The rape survivor accompanied the TTE to the station waiting room where they were joined by Sanjoy Singh, a trackman. After a while, Singh told the woman that she may spend the night in his quarters near the station. He allegedly told her that his family lives in the quarters and she had nothing to worry," a police officer said.

Once in the house, the woman realized that there was no family living there. Rather, two more men joined Yadav and Singh and took turns raping her. Early on Tuesday, she went to the GRP office at Dalkhola station. Officers there refused to pay any heed to her complaint. The gritty woman travelled back to Karandighi and went straight to the police where officers did their job. Doctors of the hospital, to which she was sent, said that rape was confirmed prima facie.

"A complaint of gang rape was lodged at Karandighi police station and we have started a probe," said North Dinajpur SP Syed Waqar Raza.

Northeast Frontier Railway officials said they weren't aware of the incident.
