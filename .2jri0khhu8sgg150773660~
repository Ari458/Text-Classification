Murder
Description:
			A four-year-old girl died after she was allegedly smashed to the ground by her father in a fit of rage following an argument with his wife in Mahabubnagar district of Telangana, police said today.

The incident occurred last night in Konkanvanipally village under Atmakur police station limits, Circle Inspector D Kishen said.

Accused Nagaraj, a labourer, who was in an "inebriated condition" at the time of the incident, had a heated argument with his wife and vented his anger by snatching their daughter from her, the police officer said.

"Nagaraj caught hold of the girl's legs and allegedly hit her against a big stone resulting in her death before fleeing from the spot," Kishen said based on a complaint lodged by his wife.

A case of murder has been registered by Atmakur police in connection with the incident and efforts are on to nab the absconding accused, the CI said, after visiting the scene of offence today.
