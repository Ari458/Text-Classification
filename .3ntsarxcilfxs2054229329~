Murder, Crime, Rape
Description:
			Two youths, including the son of a police head constable, were arrested today for allegedly raping and murdering a woman cop in Chhattisgarh's Raigarh district, police said.

Subham Mishra (19) and his friend Shivang Tiwari (19), studying in class twelve were apprehended for allegedly killing the 24-year-old woman cop at her official residence in the Police Lines area of Raigarh town last month, Raigarh Superintendent of Police Rahul Bhagat said here today.

The woman cop resided alone in a single room, neighbouring the quarters of Subham, the son of head constable Srinath Mishra.

According to the statement of the accused, on September 16 night, Subham stormed inside the woman cop's house to steal her mobile phone and other valuables.

After she caught him stealing, he allegedly hit on her head with a traditional grinding stone and then raped her before fleeing the spot, the SP said.

Her body was found with multiple head injuries next morning, lying in a pool of blood.

During investigation, Subham was interrogated based on suspicion after which he confessed that he had committed the crime.

Allegedly, Shivang helped him sell the valuables stolen from the woman cop's house, the SP said.

Her mobile phone, jewellery, identity cards and purse were recovered from the accused, he said.

They have been booked under Section 302 (murder), Section 376 (rape) and Section 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence) of the Indian Penal Code, the SP said.

The woman cop was recruited by the police department three years ago as a compensatory appointment after her father's death.
