Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A seven-year-old girl was allegedly raped by a man here in Udham Singh Nagar district here, police said today.

The heinous crime took place on November 19 and an FIR in this connection was lodged on November 25 when some local NGOs learned of it and informed police which then persuaded the victim's family to file a report, the police control room said today.

A medical examination of the minor, daughter of a labourer hailing from Sultanpur Patti village, has confirmed rape, it said.

The accused was arrested last evening and has been identified as Kuldeep, aged 20 years, who hails from Rampur district in Uttar Pradesh, police said.

The incident comes days after a seven-year-old girl was allegedly raped and murdered. Her body was recovered after a five-day search on November 25 from a forest in Haldwani.

House proceedings in the Uttrakhand Legislative Assembly have been adjourned for past two consecutive days as the main opposition BJP has created ruckus over the incident.
