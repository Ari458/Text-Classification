Molestation
Description:
			In what could spell more trouble for the suspended Deputy Inspector General of Police Sunil Paraskar, accused of rape by a model, the city police have registered a case against him and his brother for allegedly molesting and intimidating a woman.

"We registered a case of molestation, intimidation, wrongful restraint against Sunil Paraskar and his brother Ravi yesterday," Additional Commissioner of Police (North Region) Kishore Jadhav said here today.

According to police, the victim was a tenant of Ravi and he allegedly called her to his house in Kandivali, threatened her and outraged her modesty. Police said the suspended IPS officer was also present at that time.

Earlier, a 25-year-old model had alleged that Paraskar (57) had molested and sexually assaulted her on two occasions in December 2013.

The sessions court had granted pre-arrest bail to Paraskar, who had moved the court on July 25, a week after an FIR was registered against him by the suburban Malwani police under Section 376(2) (rape by a police officer), Section 376 C (intercourse by superintendent of jail, remand home, etc) and Section 354(D) (stalking) of the Indian Penal Code.

According to the model, she had met Paraskar first in 2012 when he was the Additional Commissioner of Police in connection with a case.
