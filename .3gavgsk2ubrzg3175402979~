Description:
			A man has been arrested for attempting to force his former lover to marry him in the middle of the road near Podanur in the city.

The man and the woman, working in the same company, were in love for the last few months. However, the woman decided to end the relationship some time ago as he quit the job and was literally on the streets, police said.

The woman resisted and started screaming for help following which passers-by rescued her from the man who fled the spot.
