Murder
Description:
			A farmer, father of five daughters, allegedly stabbed to death his 31-year-old wife today after a heated argument with her over not bearing him a son, police said.

Angry at not having a son, 35-year-old Bajirao Waghmare in a fit of rage attacked his wife Rani at least seven times on her neck and other body parts with a sharp object at around 3.30 AM at their Borale village home in Mangalwedha taluka of the district, they said.

Waghmare, who has five daughters aged between two and eight years, was subsequently arrested, Mangalwedha police station senior inspector D K Patil told PTI.

According to police, Waghmare had been upset with his wife since the time she gave birth to the third daughter.

"He often had heated arguments with his wife on the issue that they did not have a son. Many people tried to make him understand that girls and boys are equal," Patil said, adding, his anger grew after his wife delivered two more daughters.

"Last night, the couple again had an argument on the same issue. In a fit of rage, Waghmare stabbed his wife at least seven times on her neck and other parts of her body, killing her on the spot," he said.

One of his daughters, who was sleeping with the parents in the bedroom, raised an alarm after the attack.

"Waghmare's parents, sleeping in the other room, rushed to the bedroom and found Rani in a pool of blood.

Police were immediately notified," he said.
