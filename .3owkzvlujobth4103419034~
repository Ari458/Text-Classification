Human Trafficking
Description:
			A two-half-year-old tribal girl, allegedly sold by her father for money at Attappady in the district, has been traced and rescued by police.

According to the police, Saumya, daughter of one Shamsuddin and Thulasi, hailing from Vannanthura hamlet, was allegedly sold by her father for Rs 80,000 to a family in Thrippunithura in Ernakulam district.

The mother had complained to the police about her missing daughter two days back, which led to the father and a middleman yesterday.

On getting clues about the place where the toddler had been taken, local police alerted their counterparts at Thrippuinithara and the child was traced late last night.

Four persons, including Shamsuddeen, an agent who mediated the deal and the person who bought the child, were taken into custody today, police said.

A case had been registered against them based on different sections of Juvenile Justice Act and SC/ST Act, they said.

The child and the mother are lodged at a shelter home in the district, police added.
