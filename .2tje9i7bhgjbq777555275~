Domestic Violence
Description:
			A daughter-in-law was booked on the charge of domestic violence after her mother-in-law petitioned a local court, alleging that her son's wife had thrashed her.

Judicial Magistrate First Class (JMFC) Neetukanta Verma ordered registration of case against Vinaya with the court after her mother-in-law Savitri Panchal (45) lodged a complaint. The JMFC has summoned the accused to the court on January 5.

Savitri's counsel Krishna Kumar Kunhare said that the JMFC had directed an officer of the Madhya Pradesh Women and Child Welfare Development Department to probe Savitri's charges against Vinaya.

Based on the finding of the officer, the court asked for registration of the case, he said.

Vinaya had married Dharmendra in February 2010. Forty five days later, she mounted pressure on her husband to leave his mother and move to her parents' place, Kunhare said.

He said that after Dharmendra refused to part with his mother, Vinaya began quarrelling with her mother-in-law and thrashing her.

Kunhare said that in her plea, Savitri has stated that Vinaya used to force her to eat non-vegetarian food, knowing that she (Savitri) is a pure vegetarian.
