Description:
			Repeated sexual harassment by a group of bikers reportedly forced two teenage girls to commit suicide in Haryanas Rohtak district on Monday.
Police initiated a probe after they recovered two suicide notes in which the girls have detailed their trauma. While the identity of the youths is yet to be ascertained, a Special Investigation Team (SIT) has been formed to locate them with police verifying a registration number mentioned by the girls in their notes.
The girls, one a student of Class XI and the other a Class XII student, fell unconscious at their educational institute located on Rohtak-Jind bypass on Monday and were rushed to Rohtak's Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, PGIMS, where they died during treatment. Their bodies have been kept at the hospital mortuary for post-mortem that is likely to be conducted on Tuesday.
Preliminary investigations indicated the duo consumed poison. We received intimation about the incident at noon. We found out about it from our police post in Rohtak PGIMS, when they were brought to the hospital. While the Class XI student was identified as Madhu, the other girl was identified as Nitika. Both were attending classes for competitive exams at Saakshi Academy. We have spoken to their families and questioned their friends. Both were last seen consuming some juice. When we searched their classroom, we found a suicide note from Madhu's desk. The other note was recovered from Nitika's bag, an investigating officer said.
Police said both the girls, in their notes, have hinted at persistent and increasing instances of sexual harassment of girls in the region. They had even stated that if police fail to act against such unscrupulous elements, many more girls may also be forced to take the extreme step.
The girls had also given some details about the youth who were allegedly harassing them. A motorbike registration number is also mentioned. A case has been registered and the accused will be nabbed soon,said Deputy Superintendent of Police, Karan Goel who is heading the SIT probing the incident.
