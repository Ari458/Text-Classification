Description:
			A deputy superintendent of Tihar Jail has been arrested along with his son for trying to kill his daughter-in-law. The incident was reported from Mahipalpur in south Delhi on Wednesday night. 

The victim, 26-year-old Usha, had reportedly been of late having repeated arguments with the accused, her husband Nitin (27) and father-in-law Gyan Singh (50). The Vasant Kunj (north) police have registered a case of attempt to murder and dowry harassment against the duo. 

The incident took place around 9pm. Police said the father-son duo allegedly thrashed Usha and even slashed her wrist. They subsequently set her on fire, an officer said. 

The woman was later rushed to the hospital where she was admitted to the ICU. Doctors said she has suffered with 65% burn injuries. She is out of danger but under observation for the next 72 hours, police said. 

Usha's brother alleged that Singh and his family had been demanding dowry and used to torture her often. They alleged that Usha's in-laws had planned to kill her but she luckily managed to escape. Police are questioning the two men who have denied having attempted to murder the woman.
