Street Harassment
Description:
			A girl has filed a complaint against three youth for allegedly eve-teasing her for over a month and making an unsuccessful bid to forcefully abduct her from her house three days ago, police said today.

The girl, a student of class 12 of a college here, alleged that she was continuously being eve-teased by a worker of an embroidery shop and his two associates whenever she stepped out of her house to go to her college or coaching classes, they said.

Fed up of continuous teasing by the three accused, she quit her studies about a month ago and was staying in her house. But, on November 29, the three allegedly made a bid to abduct her from her house, a senior police official said.

But their attempt remained unsuccessful as hearing the girl's cries her neighbours rushed to her rescue and the youths managed to escape.

Superintendent of police, Rajiv Malhortra said the matter was serious and an FIR has been lodged against the three youths, "and action would be taken them after an inquiry". PTI CORR SAB
