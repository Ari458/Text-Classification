The accused was booked under IPC sections 376 (rape) 420 (cheating), 506 (criminal intimidation) and relevant sections of Atrocities Act last Friday, said Vilas Joshi, senior inspector with Vakola police station.

The police, however, refused to divulge the name of the accused.

In her complaint, the victim claimed that she was in a live-in relationship with the accused from early eighties till 2013 during which he promised to marry her and sexually abused her, police said.

According to police, the victim came to Mumbai in early 1980s to join as an air hostess here. That time she met the accused in a flight while flying to Dubai and subsequently they became good friends.

"As per the complaint, the accused, who is the owner of a leading private security firm, promised marriage and began maintaining physical relationship with the victim," said another officer.

The culprit even helped her in purchasing a house in western suburbs here and began maintaining live-in relationship, the officer said.

"Over a period of time, it was discovered that the accused was married and the victim had pulled him up for hiding things from her," the officer.

However, the accused threatened her with dire consequences and continued to abuse her sexually without her consent.

Recently, when the victim had an argument with him over same issue, the culprit told her that he did not marry her as she belonged to a lower caste.

The victim approached Vakola police on Friday and explained her ordeal, following which police registered an FIR against the accused.
