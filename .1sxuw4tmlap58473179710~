Rape
Description:
			A 42-year-old woman has accused a municipal corporation official and his friend in the national capital of repeatedly raping her for almost two years on the pretext getting her a job, police said today.

The woman approached west Delhi's Rajouri Garden police station on Saturday.

According to the woman's complaint, she came in contact with the municipal corporation inspector as she needed a job after the death of her husband.

"She says that the duo raped her in different hotels in central Delhi's Karol Bagh many times where they had called her on the pretext of submitting documents or discussing about the job," said a police official quoting her complaint.

Although police have registered a case, no arrest has been made so far as investigators are checking the authenticity of the complaint.
