Murder
Description:
			A 34-year-old man allegedly poisoned to death his two minor daughters before committing suicide here.

Pawan Verma, who worked as a salesman with a mobile service provider, was apparently depressed following the death of his father on September 22, police said.

On September 27, Pawan, who lived in a joint family at their Vartak Nagar flat in Thane city, told his wife and relatives that he was going out with his two daughters - Komal (10) and Minal (6)- and would return by evening, Badlapur assistant police inspector Dhananjay Pore said.

However, he along with his daughters went to their other apartment in Poddar Complex of Thane's Badlapur township where he allegedly offered the two girls a poison-laced soft drink. Later, he also ended his life by hanging himself to a ceiling fan, he said.

In the meantime, when Pawan did not return home, the family filed a missing complaint with Vartak Nagar police station on September 27.

Pawan's brother, who was also searching for him and the two children, last evening informed police that their Badlapur flat was locked from inside and that he suspected something amiss.

Later, police broke open the door of the flat and found decomposed bodies of the two girls - one lying on a sofa and other on the floor - and Pawan's body hanging from a fan, Pore said.

A suicide note was found in the room purportedly written by Pawan in which he mentioned that he was taking away his two children with him and that no one should be held responsible for his act, he said.

The bodies were sent for postmortem.
