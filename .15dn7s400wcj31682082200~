Description:
			A new-born baby was found dead near the Barpeta Medical College Hospital at Jati Gaon in lower Assam's Barpeta district today, police sources said.

The decomposed body was recovered in front of private house, about 200 metres away from the state-run Medical college, the sources said.

The locals suspected that the body was brought by stray dogs after the medical college workers had disposed it without proper care.

The locals also claimed that this year seven bodies of new-born babies were recovered from the area as the medical college authorities did not take any measure to properly dispose of dead babies.

The medical college authorities were not available for their reaction to the charge.
