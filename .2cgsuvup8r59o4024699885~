Rape, Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			The Nalanda Law College in Borivli (W) is once again in the thick of controversy as a staff member has accused NCP politician Laxman Dhoble, the founder of the college trust, of rape.

The woman who accused Dhoble was one of the accused in a cheating case that rocked the college last month. 

Run by the Shahu Shikshan Sanstha, the college faced embarrassment when 58 students filed the cheating complaint at the Borivli police station against the management, employees and trustees following denial of admission despite having Rs 16.06 lakh taken from them collectively. 

Dhoble, a former minister of water supply, was not arrested after the rape complaint. The police said on Saturday that they were going through the complaint carefully. 

In her complaint recorded on Friday, the 42-year-old woman, who is a clerk, said she was called to Dhoble's cabin on three occasions from January 2011 to 2013 on the pretext of work and, during this time, she was beaten and raped. She said Dhoble had obscene pictures of hers. 

"The woman was sent for a medical exam," DCP Balsingh Rajput, zone XI, said. 

Speaking to PTI, Dhoble questioned the complaint timing. 

"The allegations and FIR came immediately after the model code of conduct [for polls] kicked in," he said. "This is nothing but character assassination. The charges are politically motivated."
