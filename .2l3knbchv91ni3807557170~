Rape
Description:
			A former assistant lecturer of Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad (IIM-A) has lodged a rape complaint against her ex-boyfriend, who was a PhD student of the same institute, the police said.
The complaint was lodged on Tuesday at the Satellite area police station by a woman who claimed to have worked at IIM-A as an assistant lecturer on contract, Satellite area police station's inspector B H Rajgor said.
In her FIR as said to DC, she has mentioned that a person named Sudeep Krishnan, who now resides in Delhi, helped her to settle and allegedly lured her into physical relations on the promise of marrying her.
“When she realized that Sudeep got married to another girl recently, she came here from Bangalore to file a rape complaint against him,” Rajgor said.

As per her complaint, she joined IIM-A as assistant lecturer in August 2012 and met Sudeep, who was already pursuing his PhD at the institute.
“In 2013, Sudeep went to Delhi after completing his studies, while she went to Bangalore after her contract expired. She claimed that Sudeep had kept her in dark side and got married to another girl in May 2014. So, she came here from Bangalore to lodge a rape complaint against him," said Rajgor, who has begun investigations.
