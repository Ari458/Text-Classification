Murder
Description:
			An elderly woman who died after falling from a building in a hospital premises here was allegedly attacked by some unidentified persons and then thrown out of the window, police said today.

Following fresh probe, the initial accidental death report registered in this regard has now been converted into a case of murder and destruction of evidence, they said.

On the night of December 9, police received a message that a woman, around 60-65 years of age, had fallen from the third floor of a building at the ESIS Hospital premises in Wagle Estate area of the city.

Police rushed to the spot and took the injured woman to Thane Civil Hospital where she died the same night during treatment, Wagle Estate police station's senior inspector A D Kshirsagar said.

The dilapidated buildings in ESIS Hospital complex are mostly vacant as they are unfit for occupation, he said.

Police had then registered a case of accidental death and sent the body for postmortem.

However, the autopsy report revealed that the woman's head had been smashed with a hard object, apparently a paver block, due to which she suffered severe injuries, he said.
