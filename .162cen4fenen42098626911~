Abduction
Description:
			A six-month-old girl was allegedly kidnapped by two people who came dressed like monks on the outskirts of Morbi town of the newly-formed Morbi district of Gujarat, the police said today.
 
The incident took place when Jalpa Sanandia (30), a resident of Nandanvan Society on Vavdi Road of Morbi town, was playing with her six-month-old daughter outside her house in the society yesterday morning.
 
In her complaint filed with Morbi town police station, she alleged two people who were dressed like monks came to her house at around 10 am and asked for some food.
 
She and her daughter were alone in the house as her husband Rajnikant, who is a teacher by profession, had gone to their native place to attend a social function.
 
"To fetch some food for the two monks, she went inside her house. As soon as she gave it to one of the accused, the other sprinkled some powder on her face. Jalpa claimed that she fell unconcious immediately. After seeing her lying outside her house, her neighbours rushed her to hospital," Morbi town police inspector Ranjitsinh Sodha said.
 
When Jalpa regained conciousness in the hospital after primary treatment, she inquired about the whereabouts of her daughter as she did not know what happened after she fell unconcious, Sodha said.
 
In her complaint, Jalpa claimed that her daugther was not there when she reached her house in the afternoon. Later at around 2.30 pm, Jalpa and her husband, who rushed to Morbi on learning about the incident, lodged a police complaint against the duo for allegedly kidnapping their daugthter.
 
"After we learned about the kidnapping, we began searching for the suspects at all locations like temples, bus stops and railway stations. However, we have not found any significant lead yet," Sodha said.
