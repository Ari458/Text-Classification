Rape
Description:
			A 24-year-old woman was allegedly drugged and gang-raped by two men in a moving car on Tuesday night.

Police said they arrested two men who are reportedly known to the victim. A medical examination of the woman confirmed sexual assault.

Police sources said the victim is allegedly an associate of a high-profile woman pimp who had recently filed a case of gang rape against four men at the Hauz Khas police station.

A police officer said the crime came to light at about 2am when an auto-rickshaw driver spotted the woman wandering near the Nehru Place flyover in an intoxicated condition.

As she looked dishevelled and was not able to speak properly, the three-wheeler driver suspected the woman might have been sexually assaulted. He immediately called the police control room to report the matter.

A PCR van reached the spot and rushed the woman to AIIMS. After she regained consciousness, the police recorded her statement. The woman accused two men of drugging and raping her in a moving car.

On her statement, a case of drugging and rape was registered at the Kalkaji police station. The woman said she lives in east Delhi. Her father, who died some years ago, was employed with the Delhi Police.

“On Tuesday evening, she went to the two suspects for some work. They took her along in their car and offered her a cold drink laced with sedatives. When she started feeling drowsy, the two men raped her,” said the officer, quoting the woman’s complaint.

“They dropped her at Nehru Place where she was walking and later noticed by the auto-rickshaw driver,” he added.
