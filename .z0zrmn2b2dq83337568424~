Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			The women's police station arrested a 30-year-old man for allegedly raping his mother-in-law, sister-in-law and minor daughter over a period of six months.

Police said the man, a native of Maharashtra, is married to a Goan, is unemployed and is living off his wife's earnings. Police said that a year ago, he along with his wife, son and daughter moved to his sister-in-law's residence in North Goa.

Police said the sister-in-law, who has learning difficulties, was staying with her minor daughter and mother-in-law. The rape came to light when the man assaulted his mother-in-law, wife and sister-in-law on Monday. Sources said that when they called the police control room, they were asked to contact the concerned police station the next day.

Source said neighbours suggested that the women approach the women's police station in Panaji to complain against the man and after the involvement of an NGO a case was registered and the man arrested.

Police said that a few months ago, the man picked up his mother-in-law, aged 65, from a place where she used to sell flowers to sustain her family on the pretext of dropping her home. Instead, he took her on his bike to the border areas of North Goa and raped her in the forest. As she had no other means to return home, she travelled back with the man.

Police said that the same night the man again raped his mother-in-law at home and began to ask sexual favours from her every day. Police said she didn't report this as she was scared her daughter's marriage could be dissolved.

Police said the man also raped the sister-in-law when she was alone at home and though the woman screamed, no neighbours came to her rescue. Police said the sister-in-law also told her mother about her sister's husband raping her but here too the mother-in-law didn't act.

Police said that family members said they saw the man naked with his daughter in bed.
