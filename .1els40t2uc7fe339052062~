Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A teenaged girl, who was raped by her stepmother's paramour, has sent a letter to the Punjab director general of police (DGP) seeking justice and immediate arrest of the man who is on the run.

According to police, the 17-year-old girl from a village in Faridkot district was raped for months by her stepmother's paramour and she also accused the stepmother of helping the man commit the crime.

Police have arrested the stepmother but the man is on the run. According to police, the girl's mother died around six years ago and her 45-year-old father, who is working with a biscuit factory in Kuwait, married a 40-year-old divorcee around three years ago. The girl has two brothers aged 13 and 14. A month after the marriage, the girl's father left for Kuwait and the stepmother's 44-year-old paramour started visiting her house in the village.

According to police, in January 2014, the stepmother and her paramour conspired to commit the crime and he raped the girl in her house for several months. The girl contacted her father several times complaining about the incident. However, her father told her that he was not getting leave and when he comes home he will deal with the issue. She had also told her brothers about her ordeal. On August 27, the girl, a class X student, filed a complaint with the police.

Police conducted a medical examination of the girl and found that she was repeatedly raped. The stepmother was arrested on August 28 while her paramour is still at large. Immediately after filing the complaint the girl and her brothers had shifted to their aunt's house.

"I am living in hell as my stepmother ruined my life. She made her paramour rape me and now I want death penalty for both of them," she wrote to the DGP on Thursday.

DSP Sukhdev Singh said both the stepmother and her paramour were involved in the crime and the police had launched a hunt for the main accused. A case under Section 376 of IPC (rape) was registered against the man and under Section 120 (conspiracy) against the woman.
