Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			Jiwti police on Tuesday arrested the local unit president of Bharatiya Janta Yuva Morcha (BJYM) Laxman Munde (32) on charges of raping a minor tribal girl. Munde had barged into the house of a Std IX girl and raped her.

The survivor girl's mother works on the farm of Laxman Munde in village Shengaon on Manikgarh hillocks, and lives in a hut there. On September 21, the girl's mother had gone to attend a funeral leaving her daughter alone in the house. Munde, who knew that the girl's mother is out of station, reached her residence late in the night.

He asked for some drinking water, and barged inside when she opened the door. Munde then bound the girl's hands, gagged and raped her. When her mother returned home the following day, the girl narrated her horrifying tale. Her mother summoned relatives and approached Jiwti police later on Monday evening.

After medical examination confirmed rape, Jiwti police registered offences of rape and under the Atrocity Act against accused Laxman Munde. He was arrested on Jiwti-Gadchandur road on Tuesday afternoon.
