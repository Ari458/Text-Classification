Rape
Description:
			A 30-year-old woman from Upleta town in Rajkot district has lodged a case of rape at a women's police station against Rafiq Chauhan of Mubarak Manzil near Jubilee vegetable market in the city.

The survivor is a divorcee. She has alleged that the accused, who is her maternal uncle's son, assured her of marriage and later refused. Rafiq allegedly assured her that he would accept her son from her former husband and used to call her up regularly. A few months ago, when she came to Rafiq's home, he allegedly raped her and also refused to marry her.

Rafiq also allegedly threatened to kill her and the boy. Police have also booked Rafiq's mother Amina Chauhan and his brother Abid Chauhan for threatening her.
