Rape
Description:
			A court here today sentenced a 37-year-old man to 24 years rigorous imprisonment for raping a woman a few years ago.

The man gave false hopes to the victim's family in 2011 that he would get admission for her in a city college.

Trusting his words, the family allowed her to go with the man who took her to various places in the state and raped her several times instead of getting the college seat, a police release said.
