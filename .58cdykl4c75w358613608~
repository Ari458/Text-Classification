Rape
Description:
			A case has been registered against a 48-year-old man for allegedly raping his daughter-in-law, following which she became pregnant.

In her complaint, the 26-year-old woman has alleged that she was raped and threatened by her father-in-law, identified as Sajid, in July 2013.

The incident came to light when the woman, who is seven months pregnant, sought permission on Thursday from District Magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma for abortion at Chapar village here.

A case has been registered against Sajid and mother-in-law Naeema under section 376 (rape), 506 (criminal intimidation), and 120b (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code, SP city Sarvankumar said, adding, the woman's statement in this connection will be recorded in the court tomorrow.

The District Magistrate has ordered an inquiry and referred the case to the chief medical officer for taking necessary steps.

The woman has been sent for medical examination, Sarvankumar said.

Meanwhile, Sajid and Naeema have denied the allegations and said that the woman has falsely implicated them because of a property dispute.
