Domestic Violence, Crime, Dowry Harassment
Description:
			A woman has filed a complaint against her husband and in-laws for harassing her for dowry because of which she suffered an abortion. She alleged that her husband and in-laws were harassing her for Rs 5 lakh. When she refused to give the money, they thrashed her so brutally that she lost her baby in womb. They also threatened her of immolation if she did not budge.

Nainika Sonwal, a resident of Bakhtawarram Nagar, filed a case against her husband Gautam, mother in-law Usha and sister-in-law Sujata for harassment. She informed the police that they were harassing her physically and mentally for dowry. She had got married to Gautam in June, 2010. However, after one month only, Gautam demanded Rs 70,000 from her. Her grandparents even fulfilled the demand.

When she became pregnant, her in-laws came up with another demand, this time of Rs 5 lakh for her husband to start a business. When she refused, she was thrashed badly and kicked on the stomach. Then, Gautam had left her at her grandparents place and threatened her that if she did not bring Rs 5 lakh, they would pour kerosene and set her afire. When her condition worsened, her grandparents took her to the hospital. She suffered an abortion there, which she alleged had occurred because of the physical abuse her in-laws inflicted on her.
