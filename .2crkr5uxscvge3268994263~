Dowry Harassment, Rape
Description:
			A 23-year married woman has been allegedly raped twice by an occultist here along with suffering dowry harassment at the hands of her in-laws, police said today.

According to the complaint filed by the victim, she was married in 2005 to one Sudhir Tiwari. And, after a few days of marriage only the in-laws started harassing her for dowry, the police said.

The woman also alleged that her mother-in-law Indu took away her jewelleries and often used to beat her up leading to a miscarriage once.
