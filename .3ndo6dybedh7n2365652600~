Molestation, Street Harassment
Description:
			A fifteen-year-old girl has lodged a complaint with the Patna SSP office on Saturday, saying she has stopped going to school for the last four months to avoid sexual harassment caused by three local goons. Soni Kumari (name changed) is a student of Class IX at Malsalami High School under the same police station area and lives with her mother at her house located 2km away from the school. Her father is dead and mother is a working woman.

In her complaint, Soni named three youth, Rajesh Yadav, Randhir Yadav and Hareram, accused of entering her house forcibly on several occasions and asked her to marry Rajesh. "Once they had a scuffle with my neighbour also when they came to my rescue. They even threatened me with rape if I marry someone else. I could not appear at the final examination this year. Most of the times I stay at my relative's place leaving my mother alone at the house. On Thursday, they threatened to kill my mother if I do not return home," she said in the complaint.

The three youth, according to Soni, has been harassing her for the last more than a year. "They pass lewd comments on me daily while going to school and returning. The even pulled my 'dupatta' and held me by my wrist. When I informed my mother about it, she got concerned about my safety and asked me to stop going to school. But I want to continue my studies," Soni said.

Soni on Saturday reached the SSP office along with her mother. Her mother said, "I am trying to marry her off at the earliest but she wants to continue with her studies. We gathered some courage and came to meet the SSP. The youth are powerful and influential so we suspected they would bribe the local police officers and not lodge our FIR." SSP Manu Maharaaj said, "The youth will be arrested at the earliest."
