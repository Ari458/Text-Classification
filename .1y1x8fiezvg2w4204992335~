Abduction
Description:
			A two-and-a-half-year-old boy was abducted allegedly by two bike-borne youths while he was playing outside his house in Gagan Vihar colony of Bhopura.

Ishant Kumar was playing outside his house at about 11:30 AM along with other children yesterday when two bike-borne youths arrived at the spot and forcefully abducted the child, Sahibabad Police Inspector Upendra Yadav said today.

Hearing the child's scream, a lady in the neighbourhood raised an alarm, upon which some nearby residents tried to chase them, but the duo sped-away on the bike along with the child, he said.

Police have registered a case of kidnapping against the unidentified culprits.

No ransom call has yet been received by the child's parents.

"We are investigating the matter on the lines of enmity as Nitin, the child's father, runs a cloth stitching unit in Harsh Vihar area of East Delhi," Yadav said.
