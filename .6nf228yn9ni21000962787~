Abduction, Molestation
Description:
			A teenage school girl, abducted by a person who was engaged to her elder sister and later being sexually exploited allegedly by the abductor and his father, was today rescued at Ghaziabad railway station, police said.

Station house officer of Loni police station Gorakh Nath Yadav said a teenage girl student, resident of Roop Nagar colony of the Loni town, was kidnapped on August 4 by Deepak, who had earlier broken the engagement with her elder sister.

The kidnapped girl was taken to Thana Bhawan, a town in Muzaffarnagar district and then to Allahabad where Deepak exploited her sexually, he said.

The worst came when Deepak's father Chandveer also started exploiting her sexually. Later she persuaded Deepak to flee from Allahabad due to the heinous act of his father, Yadav said.

While arriving to Ghaziabad from Allahabad, she informed her parents about the incident and their probable time of reaching the Ghaziabad railway station by train with the help of mobile phone of a co-passenger, he said.

After getting information, Loni police laid a trap at the station and arrested Deepak as soon he alighted from the train, and rescued the kidnapped girl from his clutches.

The girl has been medically examined at government hospital and she will be produced before magistrate for recording her statement tomorrow, he said.

Earlier, father of the victim had lodged a complaint against Deepak and his father Chandveer and one other relative, he said.
