Dowry Harassment
Description:
			S Kousalya (23) of Padasalai Street in Eachanari had got married with her relative A Saravanakumar (32) on June 12, 2011. According to police, the marriage turned sour within ten days after Saravanakumar came to know that Kousalya had a 'tumour' on her body. Kousalya's husband and her in-laws allegedly harassed her. They had sent Kousalya to her parents' home. But when she went back to her husband's home after the treatment, Saravanakumar refused to take her back and demanded dowry. 

When Kousalya came to know that Saravanakumar had developed an extra-marital affair with a woman, he refused to quit the relationship.
