Street Harassment
Description:
			The accused Balwant Parmar, a junk dealer was harassing girls in the neighbourhood of Ramchandra Nagar. Parmar would allegedly harrass every girl who passed by.
	

It should also be noted that this same person was arrested 3 months ago and let off with a warning. Police and authorities should start taking such offenders seriously and not just let them off with a warning. this will only encourage them to keep doing such offences in the future.
