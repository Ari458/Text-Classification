Child Sexual Abuse, Molestation
Description:
			The city police on Sunday arrested a 35-year-old man on charges of sexually assaulting his two daughters over a period of time.

R. Perumal, a labourer of Sangeethpatti, lost his wife nine years ago. He has three children— a 15-year-old daughter studying in Class 10 and 10-year-old daughter studying in Class V and a seven-year-old son.

While the two daughters were living with him, his son was under the care of their grandmother.

It is said that Perumal in an inebriated condition sexually harassed his elder daughter last year and she informed her grandmother.

Her grandmother had warned Perumal.

This April, he had sexually assaulted his younger daughter and she informed this to their neighbour.

The neighbour informed the Childline 1098 in Salem, who rescued both the girls and lodged them at Reception Home for Girls in Hasthampatti.

Inquiries by Child Welfare Committee (CWC) chairman A. Xavier revealed that Perumal committed the crime over one year.

Based on his complaint, the All Woman Police Station in Suramangalam registered a case under Section 5,6,9 and 10 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 and arrested Perumal. He was produced in the court and lodged at Salem Central Prison.

A medical examination was done on both the girls at Government Mohan Kumaramangalam Medical College Hospital. Sources said that they would be produced before the CWC and rehabilitation measures would be worked out.

The girls would be allowed to continue their education, sources added.
