Description:
			A 23-year-old woman attempted suicide by consuming sleeping pills due to alleged torture by her husband, a police inspector. The family of the woman has registered a dowry harassment complaint with the district collector demanding action against the police official. 

D Karthika of Melur was married to Manikandan S, 33, of the same place. Ever since the marriage, the couple has been frequently quarrelling. 

Manikandan was aiming to acquire the huge family property of Karthika. He had asked his wife to approach her parents about the matter, but Karthika refused to do so. The couple frequently quarreled over it. Later, Karthika decided to distance away from Manikanda by enrolling herself for a computer class. She travelled on a bicycle to attend her classes, and Manikandan's brothers have been making fun of her. 

Manikandan is said to have taken a sum of Rs 3 lakh from Karthika's family as dowry, but he continued to harass her. In her suicide letter, Karthika alleged that Srirangam inspector Sivasubramanian along with Manikandan were constantly threatening her to part away with the land or face further consequences. 

She also alleged that the police inspector constantly called her and her family at police station and harassed them. She registered a complaint with the Srirangam Police Station, but no action was taken. Depressed over this, she decided to end her life. Karthika was undergoing treatment at a city hospital.
