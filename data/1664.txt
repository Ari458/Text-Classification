Description:
			The Vakola police arrested a 25-year-old civic labourer for allegedly molesting eight girls in the Kalina area in Santacruz (East) over the past few months. The cleaner, on contract with the BMC, was nabbed by a local resident who allegedly found the accused molesting his relative. 

The police said Raju Jadhav is believed to have molested seven girls previously, who registered complaints. The police said Jadhav is a resident of Kalina and has been married for the past three years. The incident occurred on Sunday night, when Jadhav allegedly followed the victim (10) while she was on her way to a grocery store. Jadhav allegedly stopped her and and started molesting her, said the police. 

Though Jadhav tried to keep the girl quiet, she managed to cry for help. Residents who were alerted by the call chased and nabbed him.
