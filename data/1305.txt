Description:
			An astrologer Anirban Shastri was arrested on Friday for allegedly molesting a woman who had gone to his chamber to seek a remedy for her two-year-old paralytic son.

Apparently, after their first meeting, Shastri, a married man, had started calling the woman on her landline. The woman took her son and mother-in-law to Shastri's home-cum-chamber.

The woman was asked to step inside the chamber while her mother-in-law and son were told to wait in a room. The woman came out after a while and left,said the officer.

It was only after reaching home that she told her family members she had been molested. Initially, she decided to keep mum. But it was at the insistence of her parents that she decided to lodge a complaint earlier this week, the officer said.
