Hridyesh (25), who was working as a domestic help at the residence of IAS officer D Y Munavvar, was arrested last night for killing the bureaucrat's wife, Fai Munavvar (75) in Manishpuri area on March 22, Palasia police station in-charge, S S Kushwaha said.

Hridyesh had allegedly slit the deceased's throat with a knife when she refused to give him Rs 5,000.

He was sacked from the job sometime back as he became habitual drunkard and had visited Munavvar's residence in an inebriated condition on March 22 to borrow money.

When Fai refused to pay him, he pushed her back, following which she fell and later slit her throat with a knife used for cutting meat.

After killing her, he took away five gold bangles and Rs 1.5 lakh cash from their residence.

Later, Hridyesh loaded her body in her car and dumped it on the bypass road.

Based on information provided by Hridyesh, police recovered Fai's body from a pit on the bypass.
