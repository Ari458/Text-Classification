Molestation, Murder
Description:
			A man was burnt alive in Unnao district of Uttar Pradesh after he filed a police complaint against the alleged molestation of his daughter.

According to reports, the village boys used to tease his daughter and when Ramsevak (the victim) defended, he was set ablaze by them.

The victims family blamed the police negligence for his incident.

They are goons. When we defended, they beat us. We have given statement to the IG. But despite that, the police didn't arrest them. If the police had taken some action then such an incident would have never taken place. When my husband went out at night, he was set ablaze by them, said Asha, the victims wife.

Ramsevak, who was admitted to the hospital, passed away due to major injuries.
