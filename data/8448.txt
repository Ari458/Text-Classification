Rape, Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			A 44-year-old tantrik (occultist), who allegedly raped a woman and duped her of Rs 35,000 on the pretext of solving all the problems has been arrested, police said on Saturday.

The accused has been identified as Sanjay Kumar, a resident of southeast Delhi’s Ambedkar Nagar area. He is married and has four children, DCP (Central) Parmaditya said.

According to police, the complainant in the case is a resident of central Delhi who did not have a good relation with her husband apart from some other problems in life, for which she approached the tantrik.

The tantrik allegedly took advantage of her vulnerability and persuaded her into conducting a ceremony which he claimed required the burning of an intoxicating substance. During the ceremony, the woman fainted and when she regained her consciousness, she realised that she had been raped.

The tantrik had also charged her Rs 35,000 for the ceremony, claiming that it was the solution to all her problems in life.

Based on a tip off, police laid a trap in Ambedkar Nagar and Sanjay Kumar was arrested yesterday. During interrogation, Kumar told the police that he targeted depressed persons who came to him for solutions.
