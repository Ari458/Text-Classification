Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			Police have arrested four persons on the charge of sexually abusing a minor girl in Payyavur in the district on different occasions over the last few years. According to police, the arrested have been identified as Jose Skaria alias Josekutty, K Binoy, P Ashraf and M Shinto.

Police said the girl, who is now 16 years old, was first abused by Josekutty when she was a class seven student. Later, his friends also started abusing her regularly when her parents were not at home but the girl kept quite because of fear.

However, the family members of the minor girl were not aware of this and when she started showing symptoms of mental disturbance, they shifted her to a convent, where she disclosed her ordeal to the authorities during a counseling. Following this, they informed the Childline authorities a few days back, who in turn alerted the police after recording her statement.

The accused would be presented in the court on Friday, said police.
