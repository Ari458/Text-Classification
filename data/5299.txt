Molestation, Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			A 35-year-old lab technician was arrested here today for allegedly sexually harassing a Filipino woman at a private city hospital where he was working.

The 37-year-old woman was allegedly sexually harassed by Karthikeyan when she was undergoing an X-ray procedure at the hospital on August 11. The technician allegedly asked her to disrobe so as to carry out the procedure although clothes were not a hindrance to it.

The woman lodged a strong protest with the hospital authorities and later filed a complaint with police.

"We found that the allegations made by the woman were true. We have arrested and remanded the accused in judicial custody," a senior police official said.

Stringent clauses of the IPC (incorporated in the penal code last year through the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 2013) dealing with sexual harassment and assault or use of criminal force on woman with intent to disrobe have been slapped against the accused.

Provisions of the TN Prohibition of Harassment of Women Act have also been invoked, the official added.
