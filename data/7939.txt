Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			A teacher of Kendriya Vidyalaya at Jirania has accused the principal of the school, Pawan Kumar, of sexual harassment after he fired her.

The teacher, working on contract, filed an FIR with Jirania police station this morning and a case under Sections-354 (B) and 506 IPC has been registered against Kumar.

"An investigation is on and in course of time the principal may be arrested," said officer-in-charge of Jirania police station Jayanta De.

The teacher also brought the matter to the notice of the chairperson of state women's commission, Purnima Roy.

Roy said she had received a complaint this morning and would visit the school as well as the police station with three other members of the commission. "We will do whatever is possible within the powers of the commission. If proved guilty the principal will not be spared," said Roy.

According to the contents of the FIR, shortly after joining Jirania Kendriya Vidyalaya early this year, the principal has been making advances towards the teacher by unnecessarily calling her to his chambers. The teacher's husband is an assistance professor at NIT, which is close to the school.

"He (Kumar) had also promised to regularise my services with help of his lobby if I accepted his proposal for sexual liaison but I refused. Having realised he would not succeed in his evil design, he sacked me," she said in her FIR.
