Description:
			A missing teenage girl was found hanging from a tree near Block Development Officer's office without any clothes on her body, at Sitai in West Bengal's Cooch Behar district on Thursday, a police officer said.

The locals alleged that the class 10th student, who was missing since last night, was raped and murdered. They also initially refused the police to take away the body.

Police however said that the actual cause of death could be known only after the postmortem examination.

The family members of the teenager lodged a complaint stating she went out of residence last afternoon and did not return. The family and villagers then searched all possible places in the area and came across her body at a deserted spot, police said.

In November last year, a 16-year-old girl in Kakdwip in South 24 Parganas district of the state was raped and murdered while returning from tuition triggering massive protests by locals.
