Description:
			Three persons have been booked for harassing a 25-year-old girl and also attempting to kidnap her at Ballabgarh here, police said.

According to a complaint filed by the girl, the incident took place yesterday at around 7.30 PM when she was waiting for her brother at Chawla Colony in Ballabgarh.

A car stopped beside her and the three youths in it started to pass obscene remarks, police said.
