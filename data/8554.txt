Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			The state tourism department and Puri district administration have started separate inquiries after a female employee of Puri tourist office accused a male colleague of sexually harassing her at workplace.

Earlier this month, the woman, who has been working as a clerk at the tourist office since 2013 met the senior officers of tourism department here and sought stringent action against her male colleague, an accountant.

"Our department has been preaching Atithi Devo Bhava. Shockingly, I have been facing sexual and mental harassment by a senior employee of my workplace since last two years," she told TOI.

So far, she has not approached the police. "I am waiting for the inquiry reports of the tourism department and district administration. If I do not get justice, I will lodge a complaint against him in police," she said.

Asked why she drew the attention of her department after two years, she said: "I had brought to the notice of Puri tourist officer Bijay Jena several times in 2013 and 2014. He did not pay heed to my complaint. He is supporting the accountant," she said.

On February 9, the department sent a team to the Puri tourist office to examine the veracity of her allegation. On February 6, Puri collector sent a committee to the tourist office investigate into her charges.

"The inquiry is going on. Action will be taken if her charges are found to be true," collector Aravind Agarwal told TOI. Tourist officer Bijay Jena denied her charges. "I never tried to hush up her complaint. I informed the department and collector son after receiving her complaint in January this year. She levelled false charges against the accountant," Jena said. Despite repeated attempts, the accountant was not available for comment.
