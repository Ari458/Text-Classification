Rape
Description:
			An FIR was lodged against six unknown people for allegedly raping a woman from Andhra Pradesh in Bhawnathpur township of Garhwa district, 50 km from the district headquarters. The victim, a resident of Mahboob Nagar was sent to the Garhwa sadar hospital for medical examination. Police are investigating the matter.

According to the FIR lodged by the 25-year-old rape survivor, she was gang raped by unidentified people and was dumped near the Bhawnathpur township mines hospital in an unconscious condition without clothes on her body.

Noticing her plight, Rekha Kumari, auxiliary midwife nurse of the mines hospital, wrapped her in clothes and took her to the infirmary for treatment.

Police suspect that the woman is mentally unstable and had come to Garhwa from her native place in Andhra.

However, as the victim did not know Hindi she was unable to narrate her agony. A woman from Bhawnathpur township, who knew her language, spoke to the victim and related her plight to police.
