Description:
			In a tragic incident, a woman, along with her two children attempted suicide by jumping into a well at Sottavanipalem village near Amudalavalasa in the district. The locals, however, rescued the woman, Raju, and her three-and-half-year-old daughter Archana. However, they tragically could not save her 18-month-old daughter, Yamuna.

According to the police, Raju of Turakapeta village in Singupuram mandal of the district was married to Gangaraju from Singupuram, five years ago. Even since their marriage, Gangaraju and his family members started harassing Raju for additional dowry.

The woman left for her parents house several times, but returned to her in-laws after both the families sorted out the issue.

On Friday morning, the couple had a dispute again and Raju left along with her daughters Archana and Yamuna, saying that she was going to her parents house.

However, en route, she threw her kids in an agricultural well before jumping in herself. NREGS workers who were working nearby rescued Raju and Archana. However, Yamuna died.

Raju and Archana were shifted to RIMS Hospital where they are undergoing treatment. Srikakulam CI Appala Naidu registered a case and investigation is on.
