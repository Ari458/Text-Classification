Rape, Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			In yet another twist to the rape case involving UT police constables as the accused, the victim's cousin alleged that he was sexually harassed by the cops on Sunday night. He has filed a complaint before SSP (UT) Sukhchain Singh Gill, claiming that he was sexually harassed at the Sector 34 police station.

The complainant stated that he was going back home on his scooter from Khuda Lahora, when he was signalled by two boys for a lift. The victim said he dropped one of them at Sector 44, and his friend in Sector 45. He further claimed that when he stopped in Sector 45 to drop the youngster, two policemen came near him and asked him about his credentials. He also claimed that one of the cops recognized him to be the cousin of the Khuda Lahora rape victim. Following that, he alleged the cops started abusing and thrashing him. In his complaint to the police, the victim further alleged that the cops took him to a forest area, where they sexually exploited him.

A rape case was registered against five police constables in December last year, when a rape victim told the police that five constables raped her and also forced her to take contraceptive pills. The case is at the evidence stage in the court, and the victim has turned hostile.
