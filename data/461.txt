Rape
Description:
			five persons have been for allegedly raping a 30-year-old woman in an under-construction building at Rajarhat's Dhalipara area.  

The victim's husband, who works as a caretaker of the building and lives there with his wife and child, alleged that five persons, known to be local building material suppliers, arrived at the spot late on Saturday night. They first called the victim's husband and started beating him following an altercation over some building construction issue. The gang, led by Rathikanta Pramanik, then allegedly dragged the woman to the roof of the under-construction building and raped her before escaping from the spot. The gang also threatened the victim and her husband of dire consequences if they informed about the incident to anybody.

Law and order is a major issue in Rajarhat New Town as the township remains relatively desolate after office hours. Locals allege that many buildings are being constructed in the township and that many outsiders are often seen roaming near the buildings.
