The deceased is Swarnaprabha Dhal, a resident of Batipada village under Pattamundai police limits. Her body was found in her room by her sister-in-law who informed the police about it.

Swarna, a divorcee, had this year got married to Mahavir Baldewa (46), a businessman from Rajasthan who had settled in Salepur with his family a few years back.
