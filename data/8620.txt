Description:
			A 14-year-old girl, who was employed by an engineer couple to babysit their six-month-old daughter, was allegedly assaulted with a belt by the couple after the baby hit her head against the edge of a bed and received some injuries.

The girl was found crying and in a bruised condition in a park in Sector 20 by members of a local outfitter, who called the police. "The girl seemed to be very disturbed and did not speak to us initially. However, she later opened up and started crying bitterly. We informed the PCR team, which arrived soon. Police handed over the girl to the Childline officials," said Rakesh, a member of Vaishya World Foundation.

Satya Prakash from NGO FXB Suraksha-Childline said the girl is presently in their care and has several bruises on her arms. He said the girl told him that she was kicked around and beaten with a belt by the couple and then ordered to leave the Sector 20 house on Tuesday morning.

An FIR has been lodged against Vikku Shrivastava and his wife Sarika Devi under sections 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) and the child labour act. Police said that the accused are absconding and their house is locked.

According to the girl's initial testimony to Childline officials, she is a resident of Begusarai in Bihar and had been brought to Delhi by Sarika Devi, who is also from Begusarai. "She was brought to take care of their daughter and other household work on a monthly payment of Rs 3,000. On Monday, the baby got hurt by the edges of the bed, angering Vikku. He started beating her with a belt and foot. The child is traumatized," said Prakash.
