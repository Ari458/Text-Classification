Child Sexual Abuse, Molestation
Description:
			Dhamnod police arrested a school bus conductor who allegedly molested a five-year-old kindergarten student of a private school on the bus on several occasions. 

The bus conductor - Virendra Kumawat, was arrested on charges of molestation and relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. 

The matter came to fore on October 28 when Amit's (name changed) daughter, who studies in UKG of Himalaya International School, told him in detail how her school bus conductor was 'treating' her. Amit was shocked and immediately approached the school principal who summoned the conductor and asked him about the same. 

According to the mother, UKG students are relieved 15 minutes before the other students. The girl used to reach the bus early. Last Tuesday, she told her mother that the conductor often touched her private parts and had warned her of dire consequences if she told her parents about the same. He then took her to back seat of the bus and molested her on several occasions. This had been continuing for over a month. 

The next day, the parents complained to the principal who assured them that the conductor would be sacked. But there was no action. 

The parents approached Thikri police in Badwani to file a complaint but the matter was transferred to the Dhar superintendent of police (SP) office and was later given to Dhamnod police for further investigations. 

"The conductor Virendra Kumawat was arrested and booked on the charges of sexual assault, physical contact and advances involving unwelcome and explicit sexual overtures, and under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act," said Rajesh Hingorkar, Dhar SP. 

The parents have also demanded action against the principal for not taking the incident seriously.

The school principal - Sourabh Guha, did not respond to the several attempts made by TOI to contact him over phone.
