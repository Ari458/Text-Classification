Molestation
Description:
			A ward boy was arrested after he reportedly tried to molest a female doctor in the city who he had approached for treatment last week.

The accused and his friend, who hail from Mumbra, used to visit the young professional at her clinic mostly claiming to be unwell and on that pretext used to try befriending her. Last week, the duo, both in their late teens, again approached the doctor at her clinic feigning illness.

When the doctor was examining one of them, one of the accused reportedly touched her inappropriately. Surprised at the sudden turn of events, the doctor tried to leave, but the accused again attempted to molest her. Luckily, she managed to free herself from from them and escaped.

The woman later filed a police complaint after which the duo was booked under relevant sections of the IPC. One of the accused works as a mason while his accomplice is a ward boy.
