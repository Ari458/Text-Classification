Description:
			In yet another shameful incident, a 19-year-old girl was allegedly stripped, beaten up and her head tonsured by her in-laws for marrying their son in Thane. 

The victim was beaten up by her in-laws as they were strongly opposed to her marriage with their son since they belong to an upper caste. 

The girl lodged a complaint with Padgha Police Station in Shahapur taluka of Thane district in which she alleged that on August 30 her in-laws stripped her, tonsured her head and assaulted her severely. 

Despite stiff opposition from his family, the victim and the boy got married in May this year and were living at her parent's house in Pali village of Dabhade in Bhiwandi taluka. 

On August 30, when the couple were on their way back to the girl's house, the boy's family members forcibly took both of them to their home at Maide in Bhiwandi. 

They then tied the couple at the entrance of their home and then allegedly stripped the girl and tonsured her head.

The girl also mentioned that one of Yogesh's brother took their pictures on his mobile phone after they were "punished" and threatened them. 

The couple was later rescued by the Maide village sarpanch, Santosh Patil, who took them to Padgha police station where it was decided that they will live separately. 

However, the girl filed a complaint against Yogesh's family members. 

A case under sections 498(a) (cruelty), 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 353, 504, 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC and relevant sections of Prevention of Atrocities on SC and ST Act, 1989, have been registered against the girl's in-laws.
