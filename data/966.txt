Abuse
Description:
			Social Welfare Department of Jharkhand in association with Bhartiya Kisan Sangh rescued 26 girls from the traffickers net. These girls were taken to the metros for domestic works on the assurance of good money and a nice work environment by the agents of various placement agencies, which are quite active in these places.

Victim Speaks:
A clear sense of relief could be seen on the faces of these girls' faces. I was beaten by the landlady since I did not know how to make roti (bread). I ran away from there to New Delhi railway station, where I was caught by the police. I don't want to go there again, said Sangeeta from Godda.
