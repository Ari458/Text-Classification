			In a shocking incident, an 11th standard girl suffered major burn injuries after her 35-year-old maternal uncle abducted her and later, threw acid on her in Lucknow.

The victim managed to jump out of the car after the attack. She sought help from a tempo driver who dropped her to Ramabai police station from where officials rushed her to civil hospital. Her condition is now stable.
The 16-year-old girl, a resident of Sarojininagar area, was entering tuition classes when the accused called her up to meet him. On refusing his demand, he threatened to shoot her dead if she didn't come to meet him immediately.

Scared by the threats, she went to meet the accused at Barabirwha chowk. She sat inside his Indica car. He then drove towards Shaheed Path, started misbehaving with her and allegedly confessed his love for her. On resisting his molestation attempt and refusing his proposal, he threw acid on the girl.
