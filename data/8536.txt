Child Sexual Abuse, Molestation, Rape
Description:
			Thumba police on Thursday registered a case against a 16-year-old for raping the 5-year-old daughter of a migrant labourer.

Thumba sub-inspector R Jayasanil said the accused was a Class XI dropout, who currently pursues a vocational course in a private institution. According to the complaint, the rape happened on Wednesday, when the girl went to buy vegetables at a local shop and the accused, who was living near the shop, lured her to his house and raped her.

According to the girl's statement, the accused used his fingers to sexually abuse her, the SI said adding that this act came under the category of rape as per Protection of Children against Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. The parents of the girl became aware of the crime when the girl complained of extreme pain in her vital parts in the evening, following which a complaint was filed.

The accused boy is absconding as he had gone to the vocational institution on Thursday morning and did not return, the SI added. He also said that the girl was yet to be medically examined as her mother did not give a permission. Hence the police have decided to hand over this matter to the Child Welfare Committee to convince the mother in this regard.
