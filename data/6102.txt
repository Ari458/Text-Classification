Murder
Description:
			A woman was allegedly beaten to death in Nashik district after her two sons consented to have her 'sacrificed' to bring them good luck.

Over the last two days, Ghoti police has arrested ten persons, including two brothers, for the death of Budhabai Dore (65), resident of Mokhada in Thane district.

The murder took place at Take-Harsh in tribal-dominated Trimbakeshwar tehsil of Nashik district sometime around Diwali, assistant police inspector Suresh Manore of Ghoti police in the Nashik district today said.

Accordingly, Kashinath and Govind Dore were not happy with their circumstances, and consulted Bachchi-bai Narayan Khadke (42), a woman occultist, based in Take-Harsh, on the advice of their sister Rahibai Pingle.

The woman told them that to change their luck, they needed to sacrifice both their mother and their sister.

The brothers took Budhabai and Rahibai to her; the woman allegedly beat Budhabai to death, while Rahibai managed to escape, police said.

The woman later removed the victim's eyes, and buried the body at nearby spot. The matter came to light a few days ago when Bhagwan Madhe, a local social worker, alerted the police.

The police arrested the woman yesterday. She also confessed to have murdered another woman in a similar ritual sacrifice in the past.

Kashinath and Govind were arrested today. A case under the Indian Penal Code and Maharashtra Prevention and Eradication of Human Sacrifice and other Inhuman, Evil and Aghori Practises and Black Magic Act, 2013, has been registered.

District superintendent of police Sanjay Mohite visited Ghoti police station this evening to take stock of the probe.
