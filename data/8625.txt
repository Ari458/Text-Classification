Description:
			A woman from Boisar, allegedly harassed by her neighbour for sex, attempted suicide by consuming household disinfectant. The Boisar MIDC police have arrested the man and his wife, and they were remanded in judicial custody on Monday.

The woman's husband works in Dubai, and she lives with her two children at Dhanani Nagar in Boisar. A neighbour, Pabbar Patai Yadav, sought to take advantage of her situation and would harass her for sex, said inspector K. Hegaje of Boisar MIDC police station. Yadav would knock at her door at midnight, and whenever the woman would go out to buy vegetables, the man would obstruct her path and make lewd comments. When the victim complained to Yadav's wife, the latter blamed her for enticing her husband into having an extra-marital affair. The woman consumed household disinfectant on Saturday. Her neighbours took her to Chinmaya Hospital, where her condition is stable. We have arrested Yadav and his wife on charges of molestation, assault and threats under the IPC. They were produced before the Palghar court on Monday and remanded in judicial custody for two weeks, said Mr. Hegaje. Meanwhile, on hearing the news, the husband has reportedly left his job in Dubai and is on a flight home.
