Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			The Chittoor police on Saturday nabbed a man on charge of sexually assaulting a seven-year-old girl after abducting her from her grandparents at Damalacheruvu village in Pakala mandal the previous night.

Chittoor Taluq circle inspector M. Chandrasekhar told the media that the girl had come to visit her farm worker grandparents at a mango orchard in Mango Nagar, 10 km from Pakala three days ago. Her parents live in Tavanampalle near Chittoor.

On Friday night, she was lured away with a promise of toffees by a farm worker, Bujji (35), who is distantly related to her. He allegedly took her to the village tank nearby and sexually assaulted her while in a drunken state. Later, he restored the girl to her grandparents. On Saturday morning, the girl complained of acute pain in her private parts.

Upon receiving a complaint, police rushed to the spot and sent the girl for a medical examination. They nabbed the accused while he was about to flee.
