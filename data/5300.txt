Description:
			A millionaire iron dealer was arrested here after his wife alleged that she was harassed by him for dowry and forced to indulge in sexual relations with other men, police said today. 

Kanpur Superintendent of Police (Crime) M P Verma said Abhishek and his parents harrased his wife and pressed her to bring Rs 60 lakh in dowry. 

"Abhishek forced her to have sexual relations with his friends after she rejected his dowry demands. She was beaten up by her in-laws and driven out of their house after she refused to comply," the SP said.
