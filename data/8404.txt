			A 52-year-old man was arrested by the Dindoshi police on Wednesday after he attempted to kill his wife with a sickle. His sister-in-law witnessed the attack, police said.

The accused, Ramesh Gaikwad, had suspicions about his wife's character. His wife, Kalpana, is hospitalised with serious injuries. Doctors said her health is now stable.

The couple lives at Santosh Nagar in Goregaon East. "Ramesh used to work as a watchman but is presently unemployed. He is an alcoholic, Eight days ago, he returned to Mumbai from his hometown. He suspected that Kalpana, who worked as a maid, was having an extra-marital affair. On Wednesday, around 6 pm, he confronted her with a sickle," an official from the Dindoshi police station said. The couple's kids were out at the time.

"Ramesh attacked Kalpana on her head, arms and back. She started to bleed and was in severe pain. He then waited at the crime scene. Someone informed the Dindoshi police station and we nabbed Ramesh from his house," the official said. Kalpana has been admitted to the Babasaheb Ambedkar Hospital in Kandivali West.
