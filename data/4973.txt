Molestation, Crime, Rape
Description:
			A day after a nexus between a drug-peddler and the police came to light, the Delhi Police are once again facing humiliation after one of them was arrested for allegedly raping a woman after barging into her house in Delhi's Saket area.

Initial investigation has revealed that on Wednesday, the victim, a widow, who lives with her son, was alone in her house in Saket's Sector 7 when 28-year-old constable Israle Khan forcefully entered her house, thrashed her and raped her.
The victim told the police that she first met the accused a few months ago when she had made a call to the police control room (PCR) for an emergency and Khan, who was then posted at the Saket Police station - he is currently posted at the R.K. Puram police station - came to attend the PCR call, police sources said.

The victim, in her complaint, said that after their first meeting, Khan started repeatedly calling her and stalking her.

"After some weeks, Khan again approached the victim and proposed friendship but she turned him down. This enraged him and he allegedly molested her," the police sources said.

Khan continued to stalk her and on June 18, when she was alone, he barged into the widow's house, beat her up and threatened to implicate her son in a false case if she did not allow him to rape her.

"He raped me. After raping me, he threatened to destroy my house if I told about the incident to anyone," the victim said in her complaint.

A case against Khan has been registered under Sections 376 (rape), 354 (molestation), 323 (causing hurt), 506 (threatening), 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman), 452 (trespass) and 436 (mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to destroy house) of the Indian Penal Code.
