Description:
			On September 19, the victim had received an email whose content was very obscene. She then lodged a complaint with the CCIC (Cyber Cell Investigation Cell ). During investigations, police cracked the IP address from which the email was sent and nabbed the accused. The employee was trying to take revenge on the deputy manager of the firm so created a fake email ID in his name from which he sent the emails.
