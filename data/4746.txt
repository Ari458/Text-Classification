They said the woman was staying separately from her husband as she was fed up with his addiction to liquor. He had also forcibly taken Rs two lakh and 30 sovereigns of gold jewellery to start a workshop.

After a heated argument one day, he reportedly tried to rape his daughter,to which his wife objected. He then claimed he had taken pictures of her bathing and would download it on the net and that he was going to get married to another woman.

Following this she filed a complaint and he was arrested.

He was produced before magistrate court here today and remanded to 15 days custody.
