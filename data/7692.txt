Kanaujia purportedly threatened the girl and that's why she kept quiet all this while, said police.

She is being counselled by an NGO. Police said her parents couldn't realize that she was pregnant. They apparently thought she had gained weight.

On Friday, after returning from school, the girl complained of stomachache and pain in her legs. She was rushed to a hospital and it was then the family came to know about her pregnancy.

Hospital authorities informed police since it was a case of teenage pregnancy. An NGO was roped in to counsel her. The girl broke down and narrated the whole incident to the counsellors.

During interrogation, the accused confessed to raping the girl.

A case has been registered against Kanaujia under sections of rape (376) and POCSO Act at Roop Nagar police station.
