Description:
			Senior Tripura government official Panna Ahmed, who has been accused of rape, was arrested from Karimganj in lower Assam on Tuesday.

Mr. Ahmed had been absconding since June 27. The Tripura Civil Service cadre officer was suspended from service after the rape allegation.

The BJP and the Trinamool Congress have held several protests to demand the arrest of Mr. Ahmed, the Sub-divisional Magistrate at Sonamura of West Tripura.

A 26-year-old woman had accused the officer of confining, torturing and raping her in his South Ramnagar residence when she had gone to enquire about a rental issue. He threatened her with dire consequences if she complained.

The victim, however, registered a complaint and a medical examination confirmed the sexual assault.
