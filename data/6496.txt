Murder
Description:
			Suspecting his pregnant wife's fidelity, a man allegedly strangled her to death in front of their two children in northeast Delhi's Jafrabad area last night.

The husband, identified as Zulfar has been arrested by the police in this connection.

The couple lived in a rented accommodation in Panchayati Bhawan area of Jafrabad.

"Zulfar suspected his wife Shaizar (30) of having an illicit relationship with someone. Last night, the couple had an argument over this and in the heat of the moment, he strangled her with her 'dupatta'. He sat beside her body until police reached the spot here this afternoon and arrested him," said a police official.

The couple's two kids who are five and three years old, were in the same room when the incident took place.

The incident came to light when the couple's landlord felt something amiss as he heard the two kids crying inconsolably.

When he tried calling Zulfar, he got no response from inside and called the police around 2:40 PM.

"We have registered a case of murder at Jaffrabad Police Station and the accused was arrested from the spot," said a senior police official.

The victim's family was informed and the body was handed over to them after an autopsy.
