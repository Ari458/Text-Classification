Molestation, Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			An Indian judge who resigned and alleged sexual harassment by a senior colleague has prompted the Supreme Court to start an investigation, reports said on Monday.

The trial court judge based in Madhya Pradesh state accused a high court judge of harassing her repeatedly, including asking her to dance to a raunchy Bollywood number during a function at his house, broadcaster NDTV said.

She resigned on 15 July and sent a complaint to President Pranab Mukherjee, Chief Justice RM Lodha and Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Friday.

Lodha said he directed the state's chief justice to investigate the matter, NDTV reported.

The woman claimed that after she spurned the judge's "various advances and malicious aspirations", he transferred her to a remote location.

The senior judge dismissed the allegations, saying he was "ready for the death sentence" if found guilty.

Earlier this year, former Supreme Court judge AK Ganguly had to resign as the head of a state human rights panel after he was accused of sexual harassment by a law intern.
