Description:
			A 27-year-old woman was molested and nearly stripped in suburban Chembur by her relative after she had rejected his marriage proposal and married another man. According to the RCF police, the relative and his two friends planned to attack her to take revenge on her for rejecting him.

The 27-year-old victim had reportedly taken a rickshaw from Mankhurd to Chembur on Friday night at 9 pm when midway her sister-in-laws brother, whom she had rejected last month for marriage, entered the rickshaw near BPCL road with his two friends.

After they entered the rickshaw, they pushed the driver out and drove ahead. They then got down on a quiet road. One of them put his hands to her mouth so she would not be able to shout, said a police official.

They also tried to strangulate her by using her scarf. However, some two or three drivers had seen them in the act. The drivers rushed to the spot while the three accused fled. Later they admitted the woman to the hospital and informed us, added the police official. The police has managed to nab only one suspect in the case.

They are searching for the main culprit who had planned this idea. The RCF police has registered a case under Sections 354 (molestation) and 363 (kidnapping) of the Indian Penal Code.
