Description:
			Last month, her brother-in-law had lodged a police complaint against her husband and two sons following a fight over a plot of land. 

Her husband and sons fled after the complaint was lodged. On November 29, Sen and some other policemen raided her home. After failing to find my husband and sons, they dragged me to their jeep. "They took me to the police station and beat me with sticks. They confined me in the lock-up for 22 hours and molested me, the woman said.
