Description:
			A woman has blamed the in-laws of her daughter for the death of her newly-born grand son. She alleged that the in-laws of her daughter used to torture her for dowry during her pregnancy and this led to poor health of the developing foetus, thereby causing death. 

Suman further said Anita earlier had a miscarriage due to the tortures inflicted upon her by her in-laws. Now, she lost her child immediately after birth. 

Anita was brought to the hospital on Thursday and was delivered of a child. The child was reportedly not healthy and doctors soon declared it to be dead. 

Anita was married to Anil Kumar in July 2007. Anil and other family members used to beat Anita and demand dowry from her. She had a miscarriage due to all the tortures. Anita is critical and is in hospital undergoing treatment.
