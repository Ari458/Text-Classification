Murder
Description:
			The homemaker found murdered inside the bathroom of her flat on Tuesday evening was hit on the head and smothered to death, the preliminary post-mortem report has suggested.

The victim, Sonia Singh, 27, used to stay alone in the second-floor flat at Amarabati in Baguiati. She was hit on the back of the head with a blunt weapon, possibly when she was inside the bathroom, police said.

There were blood clots in her nostrils, lips and tongue, suggesting that Sonia had been smothered to death. A pillow was found lying beside the body, said the police.


 
"There is neither any indication of sexual assault nor any sign of resistance, suggesting that the homemaker knew her attacker and had let her in willingly," said a senior officer of the Bidhannagar Commissionerate probing the case.

Sonia's husband and other relatives broke open the door in the presence of the police after failing to contact her since Saturday. Her body was found leaning against a wall inside the bathroom.

"The number of utensils with food particles on them found in the kitchen suggests that someone else had dinner with Sonia before the murder. All the utensils have been sent for fingerprint test," said the officer.

The police have also found a diary from Sonia's handbag with the names of over 150 people and their phone numbers.

"Some neighbours said Sonia often came home as late as 3.30-4 am and in most cases she could barely walk after getting off a taxi," said the officer.

The police questioned six people, including Sonia's husband, on Wednesday.

"One of the major hurdles in investigation has been Sonia's missing mobile phone. We have sought the call records of the past few months from the service provider," said the officer.
