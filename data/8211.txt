Description:
			In an alleged case of dowry killing, the burnt dead body of a married woman was found inside a large metal trunk in Pilibhit district on Sunday. An FIR has been registered against the husband and in-laws under Bisalpur Kotwali Police station but no arrests have been made yet.

Rinki Devi (25) wife of Sohan Lal was a resident of Amrita Khaas village in Bisalpur. On Sunday afternoon, neighbours saw smoke coming out of her house and on entering, discovered that the smoke was coming out of a large metal trunk. Further inspection of the trunk revealed a dead burnt body later identified as that of Rinki's. At the time of the discovery, her in-laws were out in the fields and husband had left for Delhi just 2 hours ago.

Locals informed the Police and parents of the victim immediately and the body was soon after sent for a post-mortem.

As of now, the in-laws and husband are prime suspects but lack of evidence and awaited post-mortem reports are delaying any further action.
Station Officer Bisalpur Police Station told TOI," It seems to be a case of dowry death but we are waiting for the post-mortem reports which would confirm the time and the reason for death as that is an important factor in our investigation."
