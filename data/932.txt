Description:
			The incident was reported on the Jet Airways international flight from Milan to Delhi on December 9. The accused, Baljinder Singh, was under the influence of alcohol when the incident occurred. There were several passengers who tried requesting him to remain calm, but despite that, he kept yelling, alleged the victim. 

He held my hand and began talking to me indecently. It was then that my fellow cabin crew member intervened and pulled me away from the man
