Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			IRS officer: S Padmaja working for the  high profile Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) project has moved court against a colleague, an IAS officer VS Bhaskar at the authority's Hyderabad office, over alleged sexual harassment.

She was forced to approach court after the UIDAI didn't act against the officer despite orders from the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT).The CAT not only ordered the transfer of the officer but also found it strange that the UIDAI did not take action against the guilty officer.
