Description:
			A married woman has accused her brother-in-law (husband's elder brother) for sexually assaulting and trying to rape her. The incident occurred on August 23 at Bhilowal Katcha village falling under Lopoke police station. However, the case was registered last evening when all the parleys to strike a compromise between family members come to a naught. The Lopoke police have booked the accused, identified as Gursewak Singh of the same village, under Sections 376, 511, IPC. No arrest has been made so far as the accused was reportedly on the run.

In her statement to the police, the victim said her husband was in Singapore while she lived with her in-laws and was a home maker. She said on August 23, her mother-in-law had gone to a religious place while her father-in-law was sleeping in another room after taking some medicine. She said she was sleeping in the verandah of the house, when at 2.30pm Gursewak entered the house, held her from her arm and forcibly took her to a room. She alleged that he threw her on the bed and tried to rape her. She said when she raised an alarm her father-in-law came in the room. On seeing him, Gursewak fled.

Bhupinder Kaur, investigating officer said a case has been registered and investigations were in progress. She said efforts were being made to arrest Gursewak.
