			A man allegedly killed his three-year-old daughter by throwing her into a well in Telangana's Adilabad district apparently after a fight with his wife over additional dowry, police said today. 

Accused Ch Tirupati took his daughter to Krishnapalli village Tuesday (February 2) afternoon and allegedly threw her into a well. The girl's body was found floating late last night, Nannel Police Station Sub-Inspector A Tirupati said.
