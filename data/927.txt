Dowry Harassment
Description:
			Neelam was married to Sanjay about three years ago. She has alleged that her in-laws used to harass and torture her mentally and physically as she was unable to fulfil their demands and of throwing her out of their house about a year ago after which she was staying at her parents' place in Kankhal.

Though at the time of wedding Neelam's parents had given her in-laws enough dowry, but they were not satisfied and demanded more cash from her parents.
