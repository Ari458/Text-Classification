Abuse
Description:
			A six-year-old child studying class two complained to her parents that Babu (Accused) has been molesting her for past few days.

Police are investigating whether Babu used to molest other girls travelling in his van. Police sources said that a few parents warned Babu earlier, but did not prefer to file a police complaint. 

The Accused has been arrested under Section 354 IPC, Prohibition of Women Harassment Act? This shows clearly the state of the law in India when it comes to clearly defining Crimes against Children. And in most cases, the police have not been sensitized enough to deal with such cases. I recently read that the Tamil Nadu government had conducted seminars/meetings to sensitize police about Child Abuse and Violence Against Women. clearly, the results are not good. With the Parliament always under postponement, i wonder when a strong Bill to prevent crimes against children will be passed. A Bill in this regard was supposed to be placed and passed in this session of the parliament.
