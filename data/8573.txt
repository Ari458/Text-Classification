Child Sexual Abuse, Molestation
Description:
			Two men were arrested on Tuesday for allegedly stripping and physically abusing a 12-year-old girl in Koparkhairane.

The men asked the girl to come to the residence of one of the accused under the pretext of giving her shelter, as she had got drenched in the rain.

One the accused stays in the girl's neighbourhood,while the other man lives in Nerul. Both are real estate agents.

The victim is the daughter of a single mother who works as a waitress at a ladies bar.

The incident occurred on June 25 but an FIR was registered on Tuesday as the minor had not told her mother about the ordeal soon after the abuse.

The girl told her mother that she was playing in the rains when Pravin Ramraje (35) approached her and took her to his house after offering her new clothes. At his house she found the other man, Rupesh Rampalav (33). They stripped her and touched her inappropriately, the girl said. But she managed to escape from there.

The duo have been booked under Section 354 of the IPC along with the POCSO Act. "The two men were arrested on Tuesday and the court has remanded them to magisterial custody," assistant inspector Umesh Mundhe said.
