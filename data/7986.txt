Description:
			In a shocking incident, a 14-year-old girl, working as a domestic help, was on Wednesday found locked in a cupboard in a businessman's home in Gurgaon.

The girl, who hailed from Jharkhand, has been admitted to a hospital.

According to NDTV, she has alleged that she was beaten by her employers with a mop. She also claimed that she used to get only two chapatis a day.

As per police, the girl's uncle brought her from Jharkhand earlier this year and handed her over to the businessman.

On receiving a complaint by a neighbour on Wednesday evening, police raided the businessman's home but could not find the girl and returned empty handed. The family had then locked the girl in an almirah.

Police received similar complaint on the helpline number and this time found the girl in an unconscious state behind the closet.

Reports said the girl had bruises below her waist, her eyes were swollen, and had a deep cut on her back.
