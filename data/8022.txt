Street Harassment
Description:
			One of the two boxers from Haryana was arrested for allegedly passing lewd comments at a 26-year-old model mistaking her to be a call girl, police said on Monday.

The victim strongly opposed the two men, identified as Dinesh Yadav and Amit Yadav, after which they boarded an auto-rickshaw, but the woman continued to follow the vehicle and managed to get one of the boxers arrested, police said.

The incident took place on Thursday night around 10.30 pm when the model, who had earlier won the title of North India Teen Queen, was speaking on phone at Bandstand in suburban Bandra.

At that time, two youths allegedly flanked her and started misbehaving with her by offering night rates. After finishing my jogging, I was talking to my relatives while sitting on a bench, when one guy approached me asking if I needed any help. Though I did not pay any attention to him, he continued to pester me, the model, who has worked in music videos and an ad-film made for the Uttar Pradesh government, said.

Recalling the incident, she said, A few minutes later, another person came and sat besides me and came closer which frightened me. He then asked me how much I would charge to join them for the night.

"I got scared and screamed for help from 10-15 onlookers, but nobody responded", the woman said."I also gathered courage and chased them in another autorickshaw. I alerted the policemen present on the nakabandi about the two men", she said.
