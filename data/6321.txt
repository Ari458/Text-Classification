Rape
Description:
			A 19-year-old nurse was allegedly gang-raped by a doctor, employed with a private hospital, and his three associates at his Govindpuri village residence.

The nurse, who hails from Jhajjar district and had worked for about a fortnight at a hospital at Bawal, had come here by bus on January 25 to collect her documents which were deposited with the accused doctor, police said.

The doctor, however, told her that the documents were lying at his Govindpuri residence. He then picked up the carer from the bus stand in his car to his residence where he and his three associates allegedly raped her.

The accused also threatened her of dire consequences if she told about the incident to anyone, police further said.

The city police has registered a case of gangrape and criminal intimidation against the doctor and his three associates on a complaint by the nurse.

The statement of the nurse was recorded under Section 164 CrPC in a local court on January 27. Further probe in the matter is on.
