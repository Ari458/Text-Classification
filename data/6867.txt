Description:
			A 28-year-old woman has been admitted to the Salem government super specialty hospital with her twin babies on Wednesday. According to Omalur police, the woman's in-laws attempted to murder a baby girl. "But, both the babies have been rescued with mother by neighbors and they admitted her with the babies at the hospital," the police said.

The woman has been identified as Baby, wife of Eaganthamurthy, 34, of Olapaty in Omalur taluk. They got married one-and-a-half years ago and Baby delivered twin babies, one of them a girl and the other a boy, about 50 days ago.

Allegedly Eaganthamurthy's parents Arumugam, 60, and Singaram, 53, did not want a girl in their family. "They kept on forcing Baby to feed Kalli Paal' (an extract of a poisonous cactus plant) to the baby girl," said P Thangaraj, one of the relatives. He said Baby had no intention to murder the girl, did everything possible to save the newborn from Arumugam and Singaram. The grandparents did not let Baby feed her daughter even when the infant cried in hunger.

On Tuesday night Arumugam and Singaram managed to lay their hands on the baby girl and threw her in a cement tank filled with water. When Baby rushed to rescue the girl, her father-in-law allegedly abused her. He attacked her using wooden logs. Neighbours, who heard Baby scream, rushed to the spot and rescued the infant and Baby.

They admitted her to the government super specialty hospital on Wednesday with her twins. Doctors who examined the infant girl as well as Baby, stated their condition was stable. They advised Baby to keep her boy with her as he would need his mother's milk. "We have admitted the baby girl and her mother in the women's ward while the baby boy is at the neonatal ward. We are monitoring them," the doctors said.

Meanwhile, Baby lodged a complaint with Omalur police against her parents-in-law.
