Description:
			The Uttar Pradesh police on Wednesday found the body of a girl who was kidnapped along with her elder sister from Khurgana village on July 24.
Farzana, 14, and Farheen, 16, (names changed) were kidnapped at gun point from Kairana area of Khurgana village in Shamli district. Sleuths found Farzana's body outside the village on Wednesday morning, while Farheen's body was recovered from the Kairana bypass on Saturday. The post-mortem report of both the bodies confirmed rape before murder, the police said. Angry villagers put Farzana's body on the Shamli-Panipat highway and demanded that Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav personally visit the aggrieved family.

They also demanded that the culprits be arrested at the earliest. The father of the victims, Mohammad Jahoor, had lodged an FIR against 12 accused on July 25. The police, however, did not show any urgency until Farheen's body was found on Saturday, the family alleged.

They also claimed that sub-inspector C. P. Katheria was hand-in-glove with the criminals. The police, however, denied the allegations against them. "We arrested two accused- Mohammad Adnan and Mohammad Faizan. The police teams are conducting raids to nab the remaining culprits," Superintendent of Police, Dinesh Singh said, adding that Katheria has been suspended and an inquiry has been ordered against him. The police have added the relevant IPC sections in the FIR to include rape charge against the accused.
