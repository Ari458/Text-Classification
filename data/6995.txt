Child Sexual Abuse, Crime, Rape
Description:
			A youth who had raped his housemaid, a minor, and then went into absconding in 2011 was arrested after four years by the Maranallor police on Sunday. The arrested Britto V Lal alias Pinto had raped and impregnated a 17-year-old girl who had worked as a maid in his house at Perumpazhuthur near Neyyatinkara in 2011. He had even tried to abort her pregnancy by giving pills which caused bleeding and when the health condition of the girl deteriorated he went into hiding.

The case was first registered at Neyyatinkara police station and was then transferred to Maranallor. C L Manoj Chandran, Maranallor circle inspector, had registered the case in 2011 when he served as the sub inspector at Neyyatinkara. The police resumed the search for Pinto while scouring through pending cases.

During the probe, the police found out that Pinto had moved into Maldives and also married a Tamil girl from Tirunelveli. He would pay occasional visits to his hometown and the cops had deputed informers near his residence to update about his arrivals. Accordingly, Pinto arrived at Perumpazhuthur on April 17 and police began to track him. However, Pinto, who maintained contact with criminal gangs, was conscious about police following him and shifted his hideouts frequently. In the meantime, the police managed to trace his present mobile number and locating the mobile tower helped them trace his hideout at Parassala. He was arrested on Sunday evening during a booze party at Parassala.

"We have been tracing him for about a month before we could arrest him. There were members in our team who knew him very well and hence we didn't have trouble ascertaining his identity," said Manoj Chandran. 

He was produced in the court and remanded in judicial custody.
