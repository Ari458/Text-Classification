Description:
			A Rapid Action Force constable has been booked for allegedly molesting a seven-year-old girl outside the RAF complex at Kuwarsi area here, police said today.

According to the girl's father who runs a small shop near the RAF gate, he had left his shop for sometime on Friday leaving his daughter behind when she was molested by the constable who sped away as soon as he saw him approaching.

Since the girl had not recognised the culprit the issue could not be taken up further but on Sunday evening the girl spotted the alleged culprit and raised an alarm, he said.

When her father chased the constable, he ran inside the RAF compound to seek shelter.

A large crowd of protesters gathered at the spot but was prevented from accosting the alleged culprit by the RAF guards posted at the gate, the girl's father claimed.

Senior RAF officials who rushed to the spot managed to defuse the situation. They also assured the protesters that the guilty personnel would not be spared.
