Rape, Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			A hearing-and-speech-impaired woman who was referred to a woman's home in Paldi by police, two years ago, and has been living in the home since then, was found to have a four-month pregnancy after she indicated persistent stomach pain and was taken to a private hospital. Residents of the home suspect she was sexually abused by a staffer who took advantage of her disabilities, said sources.

Regrettably, sources said, the woman's shelter home has not filed a police complaint in the matter, seeking to save its reputation at the cost of the disabled woman's misfortune, and letting the abuser roam free.

Shocked residents inside the campus speculated that the woman used to attend education classes and she could have been exploited by a teacher. School authorities, too, have not brought the incident to the notice of the district education officer (DEO).
