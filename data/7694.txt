Rape
Description:
			A model and TV reality show contestant has alleged she was sedated and raped in a guesthouse in Sector 26 four days ago. 

The woman filed a complaint at the Sector 20 police station on Thursday night, alleging she had been raped on the morning of August 16 in her room. Police said they have conducted a medical examination and have registered an FIR against unidentified persons under Section 377 (unnatural offence) of the IPC. 

Gautam Budh Nagar SSP Preetinder Singh said, in her complaint, the woman has alleged that she realized she had been drugged and felt pain in her private parts when she woke up on the morning of August 16. "We've conducted her medical test. We'll be able to establish the case after obtaining the medical report," he said. 

"The victim has told us that someone opened the door of her room with a duplicate magnetic card key. She felt someone was keeping an eye on her in the room, because of which she even searched the room for hidden cameras, but went to sleep when she didn't find anything," said the SSP, adding the woman had also claimed she saw chairs moving in the room and felt someone had used black magic to cast a spell on her. 

Police said the Sector 26 guest house was running illegally. CCTV footage from the guest house did not reveal anything, they added. 

Singh added that the woman had left for Mumbai before they could collect the clothes she was wearing at the time of the alleged rape. "We've repeatedly requested her to help us collect forensic evidence. As of now, she's unreachable. We'll try to contact her for help in our probe," he added. 

Earlier this year, the model had filed an FIR against five persons, including a Bollywood actress and her mother, for hatching a conspiracy to harass and molest her. Police had later dismissed the charges as false and had submitted a final report in court.
