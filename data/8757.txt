Description:
			Two Class 10 girls in Trichy were subjected to sexual assault by a 24-year-old physical education trainer (PET) of a matriculation school in Trichy city.

While the offender is on the run, the police arrested the headmaster of the school, for failing to report the matter to the police, even after he was notified of the issue on Friday.

The trainer, S Dhinesh, from Malliampathu in Trichy, was named the accused in the FIR registered on Friday. The school headmaster S Jesudas, 53, was another accused in the case for attempting to cover up the matter.

Dhinesh told the girls that they needed to attend a sports meet in Salem on November 27. A female faculty would also be accompanying them, they were told. Trusting the school faculty, the parents approved the trip. When they reached the bus stand, Dhinesh sent the woman faculty home, citing some reason. They boarded a bus to Thanjavur. When the girls questioned him, he said the meet had been moved to Velankanni.

On landing in Velankanni, he took them to a lodge where he sexually abused them. Both girls panicked and attempted to flee but he threatened them saying that he had a video of the assault. Afraid, the girls chose to keep quiet On Wednesday, one of the students brought the matter to the teacher's attention.

"The accused is absconding. The headmaster was booked for not informing the police," said SI S Gopal.
