Murder
Description:
			The body of a middle-aged woman was found in a forested area of South Delhi’s Vasant Kunj in the early hours of Thursday.

Although the police are yet to establish the identity of the victim, they suspect she belonged to one of the slum clusters located nearby. Residents from those slums are being contacted in a bid to identify her.

Though there were no serious injuries on the woman’s body, there appeared to be some marks on her neck, prompting the police to suspect she was strangled. Prima facie, there appeared to be no indication of sexual abuse prior to her death, said a senior police officer. But the police will await the autopsy report before they arrive at any conclusion.

The body has been preserved at a mortuary in the hope that someone from her family will identify her soon. No identity proofs were found in the victim’s possession.
