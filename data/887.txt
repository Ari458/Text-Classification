Abuse
Description:
			The victim was abducted from close to her house while she was going to college. The accused threatened her with a knife to come with him but when she resisted, he dragged her to a deserted house in the neighbourhood. The accused also made an MMS of her with his cellphone and sent it to her too. 

The girl had been trying hard to keep the accused (who has been stalking her for a while )at bay and had even threatened to make a police complaint in case he did not stop stalking her. But even after she turned down his love proposal, he continued to trouble her.
