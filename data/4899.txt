Molestation, Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			The Thane police on Tuesday arrested Dr Shaileshwar Natarajan, a senior professor of the Rajiv Gandhi Medical College in Kalwa, for sexually harassing his female students.

Dr Natarajan, head of the surgery department, was accused by more than 30 final-year MBBS students of misusing his position and indulging in indecent behavior with them.

High drama preceded his arrest as medical education minister Jitendra Awhad visited the hospital and then drove to the Kalwa police station to register an FIR.


Awhad met the students who had raised the issue more than a month ago, prompting the hospital authorities to take a firm action. Awhad went to the police station and refused to budge unless the FIR was registered. Officials from the college and the Thane civic body also rushed to the police station.

Police inspector Ravikant Malekar said, "We have arrested Natrajan and booked him under section 354 (A) (D) and 509 of the IPC. Around 30 female students had complained to the inquiry committee set up by the hospital, which has the video recording of their statements. We will separately record their statements."

Awhad said, "I am surprised that such a serious incident had happened and no case was registered against the accused doctor." He added that officials from the Maharashtra Health University would come to the hospital and probe the matter afresh.
