Street Harassment
Description:
			An unsuccessful attempt was made to molest a 20-year-old fashion designer in the Matsyagandha Express.

The hapless girl travelling by the Bengaluru-Mumbai Matsyagandha Express escaped the clutches of a hooligan named Abdul Samad (28), who is a resident of Udupi in Karnataka, and registered a complaint with the Thane railway police.

A police officer at the Thane Railway police station confirmed the registration of the complaint and said that further investigations are on.

The offence has been registered under relevent sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

The victim boarded the train at Kudal railway station and seeing that she was alone, a hooligan started talking to her and later offered her narcotics.

The baffled girl got in touch with her brother who contacted the police at Ratnagiri and the Railway Protection Force (RPF) got in touch with the victim at Ratnagiri.

Instead of registering the offence against the youth, the Ratnagiri police asked the girl who was alone in the compartment to go to Panvel and register the complaint.

They did not even question the hooligan and instead allowed him to travel by the same train and that too in the same compartment.

The girl also complained to the ticket checker in the train but to no avail.

Finally, the girl rushed to the Thane railway police and registered her complaint, after which the youth was arrested by the police.
