Street Harassment
Description:
			The accused Arun Chamkel (30), attached to Khandwa police as sub- inspector, was sacked around four years ago. On Friday, unaware of the fact that his action was being monitored by girl's brother, Arun intercepted the girl, who was on her way for some work, and allegedly harassed her. However, was not aware that the girl's brother was following her.

When girl's brother protested, it resulted in a scuffle between the two in full public view. Onlookers supported the brother and thrashed the erring former cop and handed him to Palasia police.
