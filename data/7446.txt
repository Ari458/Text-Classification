Child Sexual Abuse, Molestation, Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			The police have registered a case against a school teacher for alleged sexual abuse of a student. The girl reportedly dropped out of the school following the abuse. The incident happened within Kottakkal police station limits in the last couple of months.

The teacher allegedly abused the girl after promising to marry her. The girl reportedly made an attempt to commit suicide when the teacher married another woman.

However, the police registered a case against the teacher under the Juvenile Justice Act Section 23 for exploitation of the child. This clause, according to experts, is weak as it would bring about a maximum punishment of six months in prison.

Experts suggest that abuse of child will come under the purview of rape and should, therefore, be dealt under more serious Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act of 2012. The police said they were investigating the case.
