Description:
			The headmaster of Badahanjar Girls Sevashram Arjun Pradhan was detained by Padwa police in Nandapur block for allegedly beating up a student of Class III. She has suffered serious injuries in her right eye.

District Child Protection Officer (DCPO) Rajshree Das said the incident occurred on Monday and the matter came to light when the girl's father and brother reached the school on Tuesday to take her home for a festival. After reaching home, the girl informed her parents about being beaten up by the headmaster. Subsequently, her father, along with other villagers, gheraoed the headmaster on Wednesday and asked him about the reason for hitting the girl. He, however, could not give a satisfactory reply.

They informed the DCPO about the incident and Childline coordinator Jasmine Mohanty registered a criminal case against him at Padwa police station. Apparently, the DCPO recorded statements of other students in the school and many of them accused the headmaster of sexual harassment. IIC of Padwa police station Kailash Chandra Buruda said the headmaster has been detained and investigation into the allegations is on.

CDMO Gheraoed

Multi-Purpose Health Workers (MPHWs), who are contractual employees of the Health department, gheraoed the Chief District Medical Officer (CDMO) on Thursday demanding regularisation of their services.

They submitted a memorandum to him over the demand. The agitators said 68 MPHWs were engaged on contractual basis in 2008 and as per guidelines, they should be regularised after six years of their service. While the process is yet to be initiated for MPHWs in Koraput, their counterparts in other districts have been regularised. CDMO K Kabi said the State Government has already been apprised about it.
