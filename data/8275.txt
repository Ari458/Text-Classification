Rape
Description:
			A former IIM professor has landed himself and two others in trouble after he allegedly raped a 21-year-old girl, who was working for IBM Gurgaon, in a 5-star hotel in Delhi on the pretext of marriage. The professor also took the girl with him to Gujarat to get her a job.

But when the girl reached Gujarat, she came to know that the professor is a married person, whose wife is a management professor there, and he fathers a baby, she immediately returned to Delhi and filed an FIR against him and the two other persons who helped him in his nefarious plot.

The victim said she preferred to fly back to Delhi because the professor is highly-connected and is known to some top political leaders of Gujarat.

The girl has also alleged in her complaint that she is in advanced stage of pregnancy and doctors advised her against abortion.

She said a lady known to her was also hand-in-glove with the professor and she persuaded her to quit her IBM job and do a job with the professor in Gujarat.

Another acquaintance who promised to help her legally also sexually assaulted her.

The FIR has been lodged in New Delhi district and allegations are of rape, criminal intimidation and criminal conspiracy.
