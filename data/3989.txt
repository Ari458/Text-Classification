Description:
			A 22-year-old woman has lodged an FIR against IAS officer BB Mohanty, accusing him of raping and sexually exploiting her for seven months after promising to help her clear the civil services examination and later marry her. 

Mohanty, a 1977-batch officer, is chairman of the Rajasthan Civil Services Appellate Tribunal in Jaipur. 

The woman, who is from Uttar Pradesh and used to live in a Jaipur hostel, said the officer raped her for the first time at a flat occupied by him in the city on February 19 last year. She alleged that over the next few months Mohanty took her to several places including Udaipur, Goa, Chennai and Bharatpur where they stayed in hotels and he sexually exploited her. 

In November, the woman had accused the 52-year-old owner of her hostel of raping her. Ramgopal Kumawat was arrested following the allegation. He is still in judicial custody. The woman filed a court compliant against Mohanty. The court ordered police to lodge an FIR against the IAS officer.

She said they exchanged mobile numbers when he introduced himself as a senior IAS officer. He then started calling her up. The woman said in the FIR that he even visited the hostel in the presence of Kumawat. She alleged Mohanty told her he would help her crack the IAS exam. The IAS officer took the woman to his flat on February 17 and molested her that day and then raped her on February 19. 

The woman's statement will be recorded in the coming days.
