Rape
Description:
			In 2003, Bhura Singh gouged out an eye of a nurse working with him at the Shanti Mukund Hospital in east Delhi.  

The nurse was on duty at the hospital at Karkari Mode in east Delhi and tasked to look after a comatose patient on the night of Sep 7-8, 2003. She woke up in the middle of the night to find the convict attempting to force himself on her. When she tried to shrug him off, Bhura Singh pushed his fingers into her eyes, gouging out her right eye and wounding the left one.

He then dragged her to an adjacent bathroom, raped her and locked her in.
