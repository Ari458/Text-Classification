Rape
Description:
			Acting on a complaint lodged by a 38-year-old Ghansoli resident alleging that her friend's husband, a BEST bus driver, had sexually assaulted her at a KoparKhairane flat, police registered a rape case and arrested him late on Sunday night. 

Incidentally, the accused is the father of a college student who had registered a rape case against Shiv Sena leader Vijay Chowgule at CBD police station in December 2014. Following the case, Chowgule was compelled to step down from the post of Shiv Sena's Navi Mumbai district chief. He has obtained an interim bail in the case. 

Soon after the rape case was registered against Chowgule, the complainant girl's parents were booked under the Prevention of Atrocities Act by Kopar Khairane police on the basis of a complaint. 

Now, in another twist, the girl's father has been accused of raping a woman who is a friend of his wife. 

The woman alleged the accused (49) assaulted her under the pretext of showing her a flat on rental basis as she had to sell her house. She said the accused had shown her several flats in recent past on her request. Police said he called her to Sector 19, Kopar Khairane, on Sunday around 5pm to show her a flat and allegedly assaulted her there. 

He was arrested by Kopar Khairane police. Investigating officer, API Pramod Pawar, said, "The complainant woman was acquainted with the accused through his wife and regularly visited his place. The accused has been remanded to police custody till 16 January." 

DCP (Zone 1) Shahaji Umap said, "It cannot be ascertained whether Vijay Chowgule is playing a foul game of harassing the parents of the girl who has registered a rape case against him. After the woman alleged rape by the father of the complainant girl, the accused confessed that he had sexually assaulted the woman."
