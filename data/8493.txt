Domestic Violence, Murder, Dowry Harassment
Description:
			A local court on Wednesday sentenced a Kalka resident to 10-year jail term in a dowry death case.

Manjit Kaur, who had married Krishan Kumar, a resident of Kangan Tagra, Kalka, in February 2014, was found hanging from a ceiling fan on December 19, 2014. Kumar and his family members claimed she had committed suicide and cremated her without informing her family members.

Manjit's mother Paramjit Kaur filed a complaint against Kumar, his father Roshan Lal and mother Pyari Devi accusing them of demanding dowry and murdering her daughter.

In her complaint, she mentioned they spent Rs 10 lakh on Manjit's marriage and fulfilled the demand of Kumar and his family. But after a few months, Kumar demanded Rs 4 lakh from Manjit's family to buy a cab as he was unemployed. Kaur told Kumar that she would arrange the money in a few months. When Kumar did not get the money, he left Manjit at her home in September 2014 and said he would marry another girl. However, after a few months, he took Maniit back home.
The post-mortem examination report of Manjit said injury marks were found on her chest and hands.
