Rape
Description:
			Senior IPS officer Amitabh Thakur was booked for rape on Saturday, hours after he lodged a complaint against Samajwadi Party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav for allegedly threatening him.
Thakur today alleged threat to life from Mulayam and Uttar Pradesh Mining Minister Gayatri Prasad Prajapati.
The police booked the Inspector General-rank officer, under Sections 376 (rape), 504 (intentional insult) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code yesterday on the basis of a complaint by a Ghaziabad-based woman some time ago, in-charge of Gomti Nagar police station, Sayed Mohammad Abbas said today. The IPS officer's wife, social activist Natun Thakur, has been named a co-accused in the FIR, he said.
The woman claimed Nutan had visited Ghaziabad in November 2014 when she promised her a job for which she invited the alleged victim to Lucknow.
The woman alleged that on December 31 she visited Thakur's residence and was directed to the officer's room by his wife for an "interview". When she went inside, Thakur raped her.
Addressing mediapersons at his Gomti Nagar residence today, Thakur described the FIR registered against him as a return gift from the SP supremo for lodging a complaint against him.
It is a return gift of Mulayam as I have exposed his threats and made it public and filed a complaint against it to the police, the IPS officer said. Thakur alleged the Uttar Pradesh Police were not registering an FIR against Mulayam although he had filed a complaint in writing 
against him. They were, however, quick in registering a rape case against him (Amitabh).
The 1992-batch officer has expressed lack of faith in the state police. He said he was contemplating moving the high court with an appeal to hand over the case against him to the CBI.  
Meanwhile, Samajwadi Party spokespersons and Jail Minister Rajendra Chadhury have alleged some elements were campaigning against the SP government in the state.
