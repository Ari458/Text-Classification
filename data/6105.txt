Description:
			An 18-year-old girl was killed today when a youth allegedly attacked her and her mother, the alleged paramour of his father, with a knife, police said.

In a fit of rage, Subhash, a resident of Satrod Khas village near here, entered the house of the woman, the alleged paramour of his father Bijender Singh, and attacked her and her daughter with a sharp knife in Shiv Nagar area here today.

While Manisha (18) succumbed to her injuries, her mother is still battling for life in a hospital.

Police said the youth told them that his father had an illicit relationship with the woman for a few years.

Subhash had been objecting to it and had threatened the woman to end the affair. After getting the threat she left the village and settled in Shiv Nagar here, police said.

Bijender Singh, however, still continued going to meet her there, they said.

Earlier, the woman had allegedly told Subhash to stop his father from visiting her instead of threatening her. But, Singh carried on the relationship, police said.

The police have arrested Subhash and also found the sharp-edged weapon in his possession which was used to commit the crime.

A case under section 302 (murder) of IPC has been registered against him, police said, adding further investigations in the matter were on.
