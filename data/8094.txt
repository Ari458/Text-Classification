Molestation, Street Harassment
Description:
			A 42-year-old man has been arrested for allegedly molesting women in his society. In 2012 too, he was arrested under charges of molestation — however, he got bail from the court.

The accused, Mohanlal Sainy, lives near Napean Sea Road Chandraloke Shopping Centre, with his family, including wife and two kids. The police said, “He molested two to three girls within a week. He would get close to the girl and demand sexual favours. Some of the girls complained to the building secretary. Later, everyone came together and filed a complaint against him. He was arrested under IPC Section 354,” said the police.

According to Mukesh Jaiswal, a society member, “A married woman whom he recently molested shouted at him when he asked her for sexual favours. He just needs a chance to molest any girl from any age group. The lady later took her husband to Sainy’s house and both of them argued with Sainy about his behaviour. However, Sainy assaulted her husband and threw them both out of his house, uttering expletives.”

Mr Jaiswal said, “We have conducted a meeting in our society and taken the decision to stop entry to such person who molests girls. His wife also knew about his activities and opposed him. We have checked CCTV footage in our building compound where we found that for one week, he was following one or the other girl and touching them inappropriately and demanding sexual favours. As he has his own shop in the shopping centre, it is difficult to throw him out of the society. We are taking legal suggestions from some senior people to take serious action on it.”
