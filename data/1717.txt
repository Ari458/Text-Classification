Description:
			AN officer attached to the Vakola police station was suspended on Monday for allegedly shielding an accused in a molestation case. 

Residents of Vakola in Santacruz (East) had approached senior police officers after sub-inspector S Dhabale allegedly refused to lodge a complaint against a 25-year-old civic labourer, Raju Jadhav, in connection with the molestation of young girls in the area. Police officers said Dhabale had been approached by the locals on several occasions with complaints against Jadhav, but the inspector had refused to file them. Dhabale registered a complaint only in May after Jadhav was allegedly caught red-handed by a resident after he was found molesting the latter's 10-year-old relative.
