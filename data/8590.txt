Street Harassment
Description:
			Harassed for months, a group of schoolgirls and women fought back and dragged four of their tormentors to Jagaddal police station on Tuesday. The accused are students of a private Ayurvedic college and hospital.

The four suspects, who stayed in a rented place in Kakinara Rathtala, teased local girls regularly. They particularly targeted schoolgirls and made obscene gestures at them, says the complaint.

On Tuesday, they were making indecent gestures at three students when the girls decided to fight back. Enraged at being challenged, the men allegedly threatened the girls, but this triggered an all-out counterattack by women of the locality.

A bunch of women rushed out of their homes and started beating the harassers. They hauled the four to the local police station. Cops identified the accused as Rohan Hossain from Ratua in Malda, Suresh Bhuniya from Khanakul in Hooghly, Dipak Singh from Patna and Biplab Deb from Tripura.

They have been charged with molestation and will be produced in court on Wednesday.
