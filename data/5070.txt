Rape
Description:
			A woman was allegedly raped by her older brother-in-law repeatedly in Bhayander here as she was unable to return the money lent by him two years ago for a surgery, police said today. 

According to API Priyatama Mote of Navghar police station under Bhayander, accused Kamlesh Jain (40) sexually abused his sister-in-law (37) after he kept harassing her to return the money lent to her in June 2012 for an operation. 

As the woman was unable to repay him, Jain criminally assaulted her since April when no one was home and then forcibly abused her after taking her to a lodge in Gorai, the complaint by the woman said. 

As per the victim, Jain had threatened to post her obscene clips on the internet if she revealed anything about the rape. But finally she mustered courage and filed a police complaint last evening. 

The accused has been charged under sections 376 and 506 of the IPC, police said. 

Jain is absconding and is yet to be arrested.
