Murder
Description:
			The body of a woman, reportedly in her mid-20s, was found stuffed inside a bag on an e-rickshaw near Ashok Nagar Metro station on Wednesday. The woman wearing a jeans and kurti appears to have been strangled. Efforts are on to identify her. The possibility of a sexual assault or murder for honour has not been ruled out. The e-rickshaw owner has been detained.

The e-rickshaw was found parked by the roadside around 8pm opposite the Metro station by a beat constable. When the cop questioned the driver, he claimed that an hour ago he met a man near Chilla Village who asked him to carry the bag to the Metro station while he would follow on another rickshaw. By the time the rickshaw driver reached the Metro station, the man had fled.

The cop then opened the bag and found the woman with a muffler wrapped around her throat. Pieces of clothes were also found stuffed inside the bag.

Prima facie investigations suggest that the woman had died a day ago as the body had started to decompose. Police are trying to identify her by a birthmark on her body. The body has been sent to Lal Bahadur Shastri hospital for autopsy. The clothes have also been sent for forensic analysis.

A police team is scanning missing complaints registered in the past 48 hours. Photographs of the woman have been circulated in police stations for identification. A case of murder has been registered. The autopsy report will confirm if she was sexually assaulted.
