Abduction, Abuse
Description:
			A team of police and child helpline officials from Tirukoilur have rescued a 17-year-old girl who was kidnapped to Mumbai and physically abused. The girl was brought to Villupuram on Wednesday.

Sources said, Amaldoss of Thegidi near Tirukoilur has nine daughters. Among them, 17-year-old Leema (name changed) went missing in 2011. Amaldoss found that she went with a woman named Manjula of the same village, who was married to Prakash Chandar and settled in Mumbai, as Manjula had promised Leema good salary and food.

Two weeks ago, Villupuram district child helpline co-ordinator Muruganandham received a call from Mumbai police informing him that a girl, who was kidnapped from Villupuram, was in their custody. Muruganantham dug up her background and asked the Tirukoilur child helpline in-charge Sudhakar to file a case at the Tirukoilur All Women Police Station.

Police inspector Revathy filed a case, contacted  Mumbai police and found that Manju and her husband had locked the girl in their house and did not allow her to go out. They physically abused her for three years.

In March, Manju committed suicide after a dispute with her husband Prakash, and Leema was thrown out of the house. A human rights activist, Radhakrishnan, having roots in Tamil Nadu found her wandering in a market.

Since Leema couldn't say anything apart from her village name, he took her to the Kharghar police station in Mumbai. With the help of Tamil speaking people, police found that she had been tortured by the couple.

A kidnap and child abuse case was filed against Prakash and he was arrested in the first week of April. Police found the address of the girl's house and informed the Villupuram child helpline after sending the girl to a care home in Mumbai.

A week ago, a team led by inspector Revathy went to Mumbai and brought the child to Villupuram on Wednesday.
