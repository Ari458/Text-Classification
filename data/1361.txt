Street Harassment
Description:
			A teenager was riding her scooter along Ring Road in Telco around 9.30pm, when two men on a bike one of them middle-aged  made a pass at her. Being alone on the deserted stretch, she ignored them. But the bikers closed in and tried to grope her. She skidded, but swerved in time and accelerated. Fortunately, her tormentors did not take up the chase challenge.

The Telco victim, however, told The Telegraph that she hadn't seen a single policeman or patrol jeep during her 10-minute ordeal or till she reached to the safe confines of her home. There was no one (read police) to help me on the spot. A complaint later may not have led to any arrest, she contended. 

City DSP Alok Kumar admitted that cases of eve-teasing was routine. Victims must come forward and lodge complaints with the police. Only then can we act against the offenders. Victims can also approach the district women's grievance cell at the police control room. We will definitely ensure justice is done. For checking crimes like teasing and snatching, we have already deployed a bike force (the Tiger Mobile), he said.
