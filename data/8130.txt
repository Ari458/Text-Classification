Description:
			Police investigation into the case of harassment of women teachers of a leading engineering college here revealed on Tuesday that the 28-year-old accused had made vulgar calls and sent messages to women in Rajasthan and Maharashtra too. His calls records show that he had harassed five other women apart from those in the three colleges of the city.

Kaushik Goyal, a resident of Mandvi in Kutch district, was arrested on Monday for allegedly harassing women teachers for the past few months. He was remanded in police custody till December 12 by a local court on Tuesday after police submitted they were yet to recover the sim card and mobile phones from the accused that he used for harassing his women victims.

Police collected the details about the other women that the accused harassed during his interrogation. Goyal said he used to identify his targets from their photographs on college websites or Facebook profiles. He tracked only good looking women and used to acquire their personal mobile phone numbers by making calls to their offices or residences.

He tried to develop friendship with these women by calling them and if they rebuffed him, he began to send them vulgar messages, police said. He had been harassing his victims in the city for over three months from his personal mobile number which some women had got it blocked.

"He had made calls to women in Rajasthan and Maharashtra. We are checking if a complaint has been registered in the local police stations there. A police team has been sent to recover the mobile phone and sim card of the accused," said G A Sarvaiya, police inspector.

Goyal, who got married in 2012, told police he derived pleasure from harassing women over phone. The women teachers of the city college had given a written complaint to Umra police station and their complaint was registered on November 4. Goyal's location was later traced and he was arrested on Monday.
