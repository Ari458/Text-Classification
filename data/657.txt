			Cynthia's Story: 
Last week two of her friends, both in their late teens, were waiting for her outside her home. "I heard noises and when I went out, I saw this man beating my two friends. When I tried to stop him, he punched and slapped me as well. He groped us and pulled our blouses," says Cynthia, who moved to Delhi from Myanmar's Chin state three years ago.

"He just wouldn't listen to me when I asked him to stop and he wouldn't say what his problem was," she says. Currently, however, there's more weighing on her mind. "My landlord has asked me to vacate the house after the incident. I must find a new one by this weekend," says Cynthia, terrorized.

The two accused nabbed by police were let off in a few hours on bail. it took a whole night of camping at the Vikaspuri police station just to get the police to register the complaint.
