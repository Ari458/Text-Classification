Rape
Description:
			A man in his early thirties was arrested for raping a mentally challenged woman at an unguarded ATM kiosk on Andul Road in Howrah.
 
The accused was remanded in police custody for five days by a local court.
 
Over the past two years, the state government has battled adverse publicity over several incidents of rape in the state. 
 
ATMs, too, have been in the news for all the wrong reasons in the country.
 
A 54-year-old man was assaulted inside a State Bank of India ATM vestibule in Bengal's Jalpaiguri district on March 5.
 
On November 19 last year, a 38-year old woman officer working with Corporation Bank was beaten up and attacked with a machete inside a Bengaluru ATM kiosk.
 
There is no known incident of a rape inside an ATM.
 
The victim is mentally challenged. She has been sent to government hospital for medical test and police have already lodged a case of rape against the accused SK Rajesh.
 
The crime happened at about 11.30pm.
 
Rajesh allegedly dragged the mentally challenged, Hindi-speaking woman to an Indicash ATM and raped her.
 
Two local youngsters who were returning home after attending a marriage ceremony saw the accused trying to escape but caught him and handed him over to the police.
 
The youngsters also lodged an FIR with the police.
 
The woman was sent to Howrah district hospital for medical test and treatment.
