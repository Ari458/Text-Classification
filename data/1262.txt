Foeticide/Infanticide
Description:
			As the only girl in her noisy classroom of 22 boys, Padma Kanwar Bhatti is one defiant symbol of the toll exacted by India's deadly preference for male children.

Padma, 15, lives with her parents and two elder brothers in Devda, a village of 2,500 residents in the Rajasthan state district of Jaisalmer, which has one of the worst female sex ratios in the country.

"Girls die," she says in Marwari, the main language of Rajasthan.

Almost everyone in Devda and neighboring villages acknowledges the reality of female infanticide, a crime based in ancient custom and continued today even as much of India experiences rapid economic and social change.

"We are crazy for boys. We mourn when girls are born," says Rajan Singhi, a farmer and a father of two boys in Devda, who is proud of his long ancestry as a member of the warrior Bhatti Rajput clan.

In most cases the killing takes place within 24 hours of a baby's birth and the crime is committed either by the mother or the midwife, he says.

The situation reflects a nationwide crisis in India, where the preference for boys is partly due to the key role that sons play in Hindu funeral ceremonies.

Other factors are the substantial - and illegal - dowries that a father must provide for his daughter's new family at her wedding, and the fact that sons are often seen as breadwinners and daughters as financial burdens.
