Dowry Harassment
Description:
			A wedding ceremony was stopped moments before the tying of nuptial knot after the groom and his parents allegedly demanded dowry and the bride backed out. She instead chose to marry one of her relatives at the same hall.

S Shivakumar, son of Shankar Gowda of Hebbal, was to be married to K Lalitha, daughter of Shivanna, a resident of Tilumalapura, on May 30 and May 31. The bride's family had given him 100 grams of gold, a motorbike, Rs 50,000 cash and a cheque of Rs 30,000. After the reception on Saturday evening, the groom's family demanded Rs 30,000 more.

However, the boys family picked a quarrel Sunday and refused to let the marriage take place. Enraged, villagers and Lalitha's relatives thrashed Shivakumar. In the meantime, Krishna, who had come for the wedding, came forward and married Lalitha at the same hall.
