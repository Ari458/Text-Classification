Child Sexual Abuse, Murder, Rape
Description:
			A youth was arrested for the rape and murder of his nine-year-old neighbour in Old Chandapura, in Anekal. The girl, daughter of a BMTC bus conductor, was found dead in an abandoned school compound in Old Chandapura, Bangalore East, on Saturday night. Hours earlier, around 3pm, Trishul, 19, had allegedly lured the girl with the offer of mangoes to the school campus. According to the girl's three-year-old sister, Trishul came when their parents were not at home and took the girl with him. The younger sibling offered to join them, but Trishul took only the elder girl. Around 4pm, the mother realized her elder daughter was missing. After looking around for her, she called her husband for help. On reaching home, the father, his friends and neighbours began searching for the girl. The younger daughter then told her parents about Trishul. The search party rushed to Trishul's house, where the accused and his family rebutted their allegations and demanded a police inquiry. The girl's family registered a case with Anekal police, who took Trishul into custody. He initially denied the crime but confessed, following persistent questioning, police said. On his information, a police team rushed to the abandoned school where they found the girl's body. Trishul told police he took the child to the compound with the promise of mangoes, and raped her in a toilet in the building. When the girl resisted, he smothered her. Trishul's neighbours told media he had moved to the house in Old Chandapura eight years ago, from Chitradurga. He was allegedly part of some petty thefts too, they said.
