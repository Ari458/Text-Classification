Molestation, Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			Maharishi Dayanand University (MDU), Rohtak, sports director Devener Dhull was booked on Wednesday for allegedly sexually harassing a woman player.

SHO of PGIMS police station, inspector Narinder Singh said Dhull has been booked under under sections 354 (outraging the modesty of a woman) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of IPC. "We are verifying the allegations. This would be possible after the accused joins investigations," he said. 

According to information available, the incident dates back to May 2012, when the accused director had allegedly abused a woman player. According to the complaint, the accused had made advances despite the player's resistance and even threatened her with dire consequences.

This is for the second time in recent past when a case has been registered against a sports official for misbehaving with a woman player. In December, Rohtak police had arrested Wushu coach Rajesh Kumar on charge of sexually harassing a national-level player. An 18-year-old player from Bhagwatipur village in Rohtak district had accused Rajesh, secretary of the Haryana Amateur Wushu Association, of molesting her in 2013.
