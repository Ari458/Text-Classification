Description:
			A six-year-old girl was raped by an unidentified man who sneaked into her shanty at 2am on Tuesday and picked her up while she was sleeping next to her mother and carried her to a nearby park where he is said to have forced himself on the minor. 

Police said the incident came to light when the security guard at the park near the Mahatma Phule Nagar slums heard the girl crying in the middle of the night and rushed to her help. 

Kasarvadavli senior police inspector D D Tele said, "The mother, who was fast asleep, noticed that her child was missing after an hour and rushed to find her. We are still on the lookout for the culprit." 

"The mother is a widow and stays with her two minor daughters, one a 12-year-old and the other, the victim. The elder daughter was sleeping on the floor while the mother and her six-year-old were sleeping on the bed. When the accused sneaked in the house, the three were fast asleep,'' the police official said. 

Tele added that the girl was taken to the public toilet at the park where the accused is said to have raped her. The minor has been sent to the Thane civil hospital. A case has been registered.
