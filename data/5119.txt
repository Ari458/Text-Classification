Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A six-year-old girl student was allegedly raped by "unknown persons" at a prominent school here, leading to angry protests by parents who besieged the institution today, demanding action from the management.

"A six-year-old girl student was allegedly raped by unknown persons at Vibgyor High School under Varthur Police Station limits, which came to light on July 15," Joint Commissioner of Police (Law and Order-East) K V Sharat Chandra told PTI here.

The girl was sent for medical examination and the Forensic Science Laboratory report is awaited, he said.

Chandra said investigation is underway and there have been no arrests so far. Parents allege that the accused were school staffers, he said.

Enraged over the incident, hundreds of parents swarmed the school demanding answers from the management whom they accused of being "insensitive" and not forthcoming with information, as they suspected involvement of some staffers.

Demanding action against the staffers over their alleged involvement, the irate parents tried to force their way into the building as police tried to pacify them. Window glasses were broken in the melee.

Addressing the agitating parents, Rustom Kerawala, spokesperson for the management said, "If somebody is found guilty of raping, let him be hanged." 

He said the school management was co-operating with the investigating authorities. "We are waiting for the final conclusion from authorities." 

Kerawala sought to pacify the parents, saying that security would be stepped up and "safety of the child is paramount."
