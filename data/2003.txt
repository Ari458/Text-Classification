Rape
Description:
			A 15-year-old girl was allegedly gangraped in Mapusa town, police said today.
"The incident had taken place twenty days back, when the girl was invited by one of the accused at his house, claiming that his mother wants to speak to her," Vishram Borkar, Superintendent of Police (North) said.
	However, the girl was forced to drink some beverage laced with sedative, following which she fell unconscious and was later gangraped, he said.
	The complaint was lodged days after the incident as the school-going victim could not muster courage to tell about the incident to her parents. However, a complaint was lodged
yesterday after she narrated the incident to them.
	Even after the incident, the accused had been demanding sexual favours from the girl, by threatening her to defame her socially.
	Results of the medical examination conducted on the girl are awaited, police said.
