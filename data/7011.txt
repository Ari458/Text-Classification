Human Trafficking
Description:
			A daily wage labourer from Gudiyattam has appealed to the district administration for help in rescuing his wife, who while working in Dubai is allegedly facing harassment at her workplace.

Alibaba, a resident of Kalliammanpatti near Picthanoor in Gudiyattam, submitted a petition to officials of the district administration during the weekly public grievance meeting. In his petition, he said that his wife, Sajeena Banu, had left for Dubai to work as a nursing help (ayah). She is reportedly being tortured at the workplace, according to sources.

His petition also said that the agent who had recruited her for the job had allegedly sold her for Rs one lakh to another employer.

He had come to know about this when he had spoken to his wife over the phone last week.

Alibaba said his wife was scared of continuing to work in Dubai and felt threatened for her life as she was facing a lot of harassment at the workplace. Banu, aged about 35 years, had gone to Dubai through an agent in KV Kuppam.

Her husband demanded action against the agent and appealed to officials to take steps to bring back his wife home safely. He said that she had decided to take up the job owing to their financial constraints. The couple has two daughters and was facing a lot of difficulties to make ends meet. Repeated attempts to reach Collector have went in vain.
