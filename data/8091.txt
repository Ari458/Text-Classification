Domestic Violence, Dowry Harassment
Description:
			A Delhi court has sentenced a father-son duo to seven years of imprisonment for driving the son's wife to suicide by torturing her for dowry.

Though the duo was held guilty under section 304-B (dowry death) of the IPC, which provides for a maximum punishment of life term, Additional Sessions Judge R.B. Singh awarded them a sentence of seven years imprisonment after taking into account their submission seeking leniency. Counsel for Tara Dutt, the victim's father-in-law, argued that three of his four children were unmarried and dependent on him. The counsel added that the guilty had to take care of his ailing mother and wife. The counsel for the victim's husband, meanwhile, argued that he had a three-year-old son to take care of. Kailash Chand had married the woman in 2010.

This court is of the considered opinion that seeing the facts and circumstances of the case and seeing the totality of the circumstances, a leniency is warranted in awarding the sentence to both the convicts. Consequently, both the convicts, Tara Dutt and his son Kailash Chand are awarded rigorous imprisonment for a term of three years with a fine of Rs. 20,000 each for the offence under section 498-A (punishment for subjecting a married woman to cruelty) and rigorous imprisonment for seven years to both convicts under section 304-B (dowry death) of IPC, the Judge said.
