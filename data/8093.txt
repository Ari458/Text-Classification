Murder
Description:
			A decomposed body of an unidentified woman was found inside a bag in a drain near northeast Delhi's Welcome area on Tuesday afternoon. Police said that the woman seemed to be around 25-26 years of age and had bruises on her body.

The incident came to light around 3.30pm when a bag was spotted by the locals in the drain beside 66 Foota Road in the area. The bag's strong foul smell attracted suspicion from the residents who then pulled it out of the drain and found the woman's body in it.

The locals immediately called up the police and the body was sent for post mortem.

"A case of murder has been registered. No documents were found with the deceased which could help identify her identity. The body was not found in an unclothed state however a possibility of sexual assault can't be ruled out unless post mortem reports arrive," said a senior police official.

According to police, the murder was committed at least 2-3 days ago as the body was in a very bad state, making it beyond recognition.

The police said they are tracking missing person records in all police stations of the area and local residents are being questioned. CCTV footage from premises close to the drain where the body was found is also being checked, they added.

A week ago, body of an unidentified woman, aged around 30 years, was found inside a trunk dumped in a drain in northeast Delhi's Seelampur area.
