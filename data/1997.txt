Rape
Description:
			Paying rich tributes to the Delhi gang-rape victim, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today said the loss of her life would not go in vain even as her mother demanded death penalty for the rapists, particularly the
juvenile.
    "Her courage and her zest for life will always serve as an inspiration to us. We should all pay tribute to her by resolving that we will not let the loss of her life go in vain and will work together to enhance the safety and security of women in our country," he said.
    Earlier, Singh honoured her by giving away the 'Daughter of India' award, which was received by the victim's parents at the NDTV Indians of the Year award function here.
    Singh lauded the work of the Justice J S Verma Committee which recommended changes in criminal law to be able to deal more effectively with heinous crimes against women.
    "As I have said on an earlier occasion as well, there is a great deal that needs to be done not only for making women safer and more secure in our country, but also for empowering
them socially and economically. Our Government will continue to make all possible efforts in this direction," he said.
    At the function, the victim's mother demanded death sentence for the five rapists, particularly the juvenile, who had asked her to board the bus.
    "I would request you to put in place such systems so that such heinous crimes do not recur. All the five accused should get death penalty, particularly the juvenile. He should be
hanged," she said.
    On December 16 last year, the young woman, along with her friend, had boarded a bus in south Delhi only to be raped by six men on the vehicle. They had also beaten her friend and thrown them both outside the moving bus.
    The young woman died in a Singapore hospital later.
