Rape, Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			The police are on the lookout for R. Satyanarayana, Mandal Development Officer posted at Araku Valley, for his alleged involvement in cheating and repeated raping of a girijan woman.

Based on a complaint lodged by the 45-year-old woman on Wednesday, the police booked a case against the official under IPC Sections 376, 420, and 417.

According to the police, about four months ago, the officer asked the woman, who was employed as a sweeper in his office, to take care of his domestic chores too.

Later, he trapped the woman with his sweet talk and sexually exploited her. He had even promised to marry the woman, a widow and mother of two children. The officer's misdeed was exposed when his wife and children came to Araku for summer vacation.

The girijan woman demanded that the MDO marry her. When he refused and assaulted her, the woman lodged a complaint with the Araku police. Ever since, the accused is on the run.
