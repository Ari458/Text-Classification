Murder
Description:
			A four-year-old boy from Mumbra was beaten to death by the paramour of his mother as he was a hindrance to their illicit relationship, said the police. 

The deceased's mother had divorced her husband three years ago and lived in Dhoom compound at Kausa with her three children, including two daughters and the victim. 

The accused, Ameer Sayyed, is a history-sheeter and has several cases of robbery registered against him. He developed an intimate relationship with the deceased's mother three months ago and used to frequent her house, said the police. 

"Sayyed considered the three children as a hindrance to his relationship with their mother. He used to beat them up frequently," said a police official. 

On Monday, around 10:30am, the deceased asked his mother for milk and the mother obliged. However, when he had the milk, he started vomiting, which irked the accused. He beat up the boy black and blue after which the boy fell unconscious, added the official. 

When the boy's sister came to his rescue, she was also beaten up and got her hand fractured. Sayyed then threatened the family to not reveal anything to anybody. The boy was rushed to the hospital where the mother told the doctors that he had fits and fell unconscious. The boy, however, died while undergoing medical treatment and the police registered a case against the accused.
