Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A 15-year-old girl has accused her stepfather of raping her for over a year after which the man was arrested from their residence in southeast Delhi's Jamia Nagar on Tuesday . The girl is at about two and-a-half months pregnant, police said. 

Her mother had initially ignored the girl's complaints of medical issues. But when the problem persisted she got the girl checked up. 

"After sensing pregnancy, the woman questioned her daughter but she tried to hide the matter. However, upon pressuring the girl opened up and told her about the rape. The woman then informed her friends who approached the police," said a senior official. 

A medical examination confirmed that the girl was pregnant. "A case of rape and under POCSO Act was registered against the accused and he was arrested," the official added. 

A senior officer said that while the actual duration of the abuse is not known, initial investigations suggest she was repeatedly raped for at least a year. 

The girl told police that her stepfather would rape her when her mother, a housemaid, left home for work. She had dropped out of school a few years ago. The man allegedly threatened her with death whenever she resisted his bid. "She was so terrified of her stepfather that she never showed signs of abuse all these months," said the cop who talked with the survivor's mother. 

After separation from her first husband, the girl's mother had married the accused around seven years ago.
