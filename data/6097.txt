Description:
			A married woman was today found dead under mysterious circumstances at her residence in Krishna Nagar area here with her parents alleging that she had been murdered by her husband for not bearing a son.

According to police, Samiksha (24) was allegedly found hanging from a ceiling fan by her in-laws this morning who informed about it to her parents around 11 am.

"The body was brought down from the fan even before we could reach the spot. We saw the body in the hospital, but it looks unlikely that she committed suicide. There were no marks on her neck and her open hair suggests she was beaten before being killed," the police said.

Samiksha got married to Naresh four years ago and they have a two-year-old daughter. The woman was staying with her husband at her in-laws' house in Krishna Nagar area here.

A senior police official said they are in the process of registering an FIR in the case against the husband.

"It seems to be a case of cruelty. However, no arrests have been made so far," he said.

The official said the matter will be probed by a sub-divisional magistrate as the woman was married for less than seven years.

Police is presently investigating the allegations, he added.
