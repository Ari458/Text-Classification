Rape
Description:
			A teenage girl was allegedly raped by a juvenile at a famous mall in Thane around 9.30am. The accused lured the victim on the pretext of teaching her how to make ice cream.

After the incident, the ice cream was closed the next day and a notice was put up stating, "Store closed for operational reason".

According to police, the victim, an employee at the shop, reached the ice cream shop early morning. She told the accused that she wanted to learn how to serve and make an ice cream. However, the accused, who is 16-year-old, asked her for sexual favours, which she denied. But he forced himself on her.

Later, the victim went home and narrated her ordeal to her parents. Her parents approached the police and lodged a complaint against. The accused was arrested from his flat.

An official from the mall said, "This is the first time such an incident has taken place in our mall. We have asked the police to take necessary action against the culprit. The ice cream shop is located in the mall but it's on rent. So, the recruitment is done by the parlour owner."

The security guard at the mall said, "We did not hear any girl screaming for help else we would have saved her. Also, in the morning, the sweeper comes but no one heard anything."

The victim was threatened so she registered a complain later. The girl joined the ice cream parlor recently and the accused had been working for four months. We will send both the accused and victim for medical test.
