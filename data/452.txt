Abuse
Description:
			A ten-year-old girl who was brought by a journalist to the Pallavaram police station on a sexual abuse complaint was allegedly kept in police custody for more than 24 hours. Later, police arrested her mother's boyfriend on charges of sexual abuse.
The child told the police that her mother's paramour, NSiva, 30, had been sexually abusing her for several months.

Activists from the child helpline said the child had been in police custody for more than a day. "The station officials kept the child in the station without woman police support and failed to send the child for medical test," an official from the helpline said. Kamala was sent to the government home at Kellys, Purasawalkam on Thursday. The police, however, said they kept the child for only five hours for the purpose of identifying the accused. "We tried to hand over the child to the court earlier but we were not able to do that since the court writer was absent,"
