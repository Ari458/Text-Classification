Description:
			Shalinder Kaur was married to Hakam Singh for the last 21 years. The couple has three daughters, but the addiction of Hakam has been creating problems for the family for the last many years. Hakam has been snatching money from his wife, who, along with her daughter, works as a laborer. 

On this unfortunate day, Hakam demanded money from his wife to purchase liquor, but she refused as she had spent all money on purchasing grocery items. Following her refusal, Hakam tried to take away paddy, lying in a bag, for sale. But when she did not allow her husband to take paddy, Hakam allegedly poured kerosene oil on her and set her afire.
