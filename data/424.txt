Description:
			A middle-aged Dalit woman was brazenly paraded naked in Chandwapur village of Uttar Pradesh Lakhimpur Kheri district on Saturday.

An affluent Dalit family put Ram Pyari, 45, through this public humiliation as they believed her husband, Darbari Lal, had helped their daughter Jayanti elope. Jayanti, a divorcee, had been living with her parents for the past two years. She had eloped with Mannu, a youth from the village.

SP Amit Chandra confirmed the incident and said five youth from the family have been arrested.  It was a well- planned crime. While Haridwari Lal, Jayanti's father, was registering a complaint against Darbadi Lal at Isanagar police station, his family members were torturing Ram Pyari, he said.

They had kidnapped and locked her in their house on Friday night. However, they paraded her naked the next morning when she couldn’t give any clue about Jayanti's whereabouts, he further said. Ram Pyari later told the police that out of the 500 in the village no one had dared to intervene to save her.
