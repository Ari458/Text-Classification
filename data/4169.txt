			The 13-year-old victim, hailing from Maharashtra's Sindhudurg district, used to stay with the family of the accused at Jogesh Park locality on Mira Road here and do petty jobs for them as her father did not take proper care of her and was a habitual drinker.

The family of the accused, identified as one Pradhan Kaka, a retired BMC worker, used to allegedly give the victim tranquilisers and taking advantage of her drowsy state, the accused repeatedly raped her for the last 7-8 months, Mira Road police station inspector Dhanaji Kshirsagar.
