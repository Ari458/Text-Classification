Description:
			The reception at Manora, one of the four MLA hostels in Mumbai, receives at least two dozen complaints every day about obscene calls received from the hostel's numbers. 

Floor manager Sambhaji Shinde on Tuesday confirmed that he has received several calls from harrowed women, but added that it would be impossible to pin point blame because the hostel has over 300 extensions. "Sometime back we had received several complaints about such calls being made from here and then the calls stopped suddenly. Now again, we have begun receiving complaints," he said.
