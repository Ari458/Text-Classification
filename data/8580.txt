Domestic Violence
Description:
			Following a family dispute, a man slashed his 23-year-old wife and her parents in Tirunelveli district on Wednesday. He also threw his two young daughters from the first floor of the house. All the five injured are undergoing treatment at the government hospital. Police have launched a search for the accused, Brammakutti from Brahmadesam near Ambasamudram in Tirunelveli district.

The incident took place on Wednesday morning at the accused's in-laws' house, police said. "Brammakutti was working as a car driver. However, he was irregular in work and often picked up quarrels with his wife B Rajam, 23. As he was not meeting the household expenses, Rajam left him two months ago and was staying at her parents' house in Ambasamudram along with her two children one aged five and the other, one," a police officer told TOI.

Brammakutti has been trying to persuade his wife to live with him. However, she was firm in her decision to stay back. "The accused went to his in-laws' house on Wednesday morning and again called his wife to come back to his house. A quarrel erupted between the two. He took out a sickle he had carried with him and slashed Rajam and her parents Chandrasekar and Muthualakshmi. When he saw his frightened children screaming and running away from the place, Brammakutti threw both of them from the first floor of the house. He has gone underground," the officer added.
