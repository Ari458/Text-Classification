			A 4-year-old girl, who had gone missing since yesterday, was found dead today with police suspecting the victim may have been raped before being killed.

"The child has been found murdered. We cannot confirm at this stage if she was raped also, which will be established only after the post-mortem examination," Chandigarh's SSP, Sukhchain Singh Gill said today, after parents of the victim and locals staged protest here.

The body of the girl was found this morning at colony number 4.

The minor had gone missing since yesterday evening, after which her parents had filled a missing complaint with the police.

The situation in the colony was tense and heavy police force has been deployed to maintain law and order as the girl's parents and other locals have been protesting since this morning against the incident.
