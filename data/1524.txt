Foeticide/Infanticide
Description:
			A gynecologist identified as Pramila Choksey was caught for sex determination of the foetus in Vaishali Nagar. 

Following complaints, the joint team of the PCPNDT wing of the medical and health department and Vaishali Nagar police sent a pregnant woman as a decoy to the doctor who owns a private clinic. 

The patient asked the doctor if sex determination of the foetus was possible through sonography, to which the doctor replied in the positive and demanded that she be paid Rs 3,500 for test.
