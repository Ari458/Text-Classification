Molestation, Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			A student of Lucknow University on Thursday lodged a complaint of sexual harassment against a professor in the department of English and modern European languages.

A committee has been formed by the vice-chancellor, SB Nimse, to investigate the incident and submit a report to him in two days.

The student of diploma in proficiency in French in her complaint to the proctor office alleged that the professor passed obscene comments, asked her to meet him personally after the lecture and physically harassed her.

"During the lecture, he used obscene remarks, sexually harassed me and suggested how to dress up and come for lectures," said the student.
In her complaint letter to the proctor office, the student has alleged that on Thursday when she went to attend the morning lecture, the professor told her there would be no lecture. He said her attendance was low and asked her to meet him personally.

When the student went to him to say that she was regular to class, the professor allegedly said, "Aisa milna bhi koi milna hai. (What use is this kind of meeting). Meet me personally."
The student said he tried to touch her and when she resisted, the professor held her by the waist and tried to physically harass her. The student ran to her friends for help and told them of the entire incident.

A complaint was lodged against the professor at the proctor office then.

Denying the allegations, the professor said: "The student was irregular to class and I scolded her on Thursday morning for not attending lectures. The allegations made by her are completely false and fabricated." A committee headed by women's assistance and grievance redressal committee chairperson Alka Srivastava has been formed for preliminary investigation. "The committee has to submit the preliminary report to the VC on Saturday," said LU proctor Nishi Pandey.
