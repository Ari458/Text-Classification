Rape, Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			A 26-year-old woman tried to commit suicide at Garfa on Friday after a local astrologer reportedly tried to rape her when she went to him for consultation. The victim has been admitted to a hospital in a critical condition. 

Police have arrested the accused, Amal Sil (62), of Jadavgarh. A case of rape and criminal intimidation has also been started. DC-south suburban Santosh Pandey said the rape survivor had gone to the astrologer's home around 8.30pm on Thursday to find solutions to her father's financial crisis. 

"The accused suddenly switched off the light of the room and tried to force himself on her. The woman screamed for help and managed to escape. Upon returning home, she took some phenyl in a bid to end her life. Her family members rushed her to hospital," said Pandey.
