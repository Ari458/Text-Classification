Domestic Violence, Dowry Harassment
Description:
			Yet another innocent life fell prey to the greedy demands of dowry mongers. The Nallasopara police have arrested a 29-year-old man on charges of dowry harassment and abetting the suicide of his 28-year-old wife. Anita Jaiswal (28), doused herself with kerosene and set herself on fire at her apartment in the Tulinj Road area of Nallasopara (east) on Sunday night, police said.

Anita, who sustained 98 per cent injuries died before she could be reached at hospital. In his complaint to the police, Anita's father stated that his daughter was constantly being harassed physically and mentally for more dowry by his son-in-law, Shekhar Jaiswal. Initially, they succumbed to the pressure and arm-twisting tactic, but later on became helpless when Shekhar's demands escalated beyond their reach. And recently he began the fresh round of torture to press for his demands for Rs 5 lakh cash he needed to start his new business.

Unable to bear the ordeal, Anita took the extreme step. Following investigations, the police arrested Shekhar and booked him under Sections 498 ( A) and 306 of the IPC. He has been remanded to six- day police custody by the Sessions Court, Vasai, said an investigating officer.
