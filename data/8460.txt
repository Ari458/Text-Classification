Abduction, Abuse
Description:
			A 14-year-old girl from Mysuru paid the price of trusting a 21-year-old man she knew only for five days. Convinced that she will lead a happy married life, she agreed to elope with the truck driver from Rajasthan.

Taken to a village in Alwar district, the minor soon realized the evil designs of her lover. Abused for more than two weeks, the trauma ended when she decided to call her father, a tea vendor. City police rescued the girl from Rajasthan, and brought her to Mysuru on Sunday. Ravi, the truck driver, has been arrested for allegedly kidnapping and abusing the girl.

The minor was trapped by Ravi when he was in Mysuru to deliver a consignment. Along with another driver from Haryana, Ravi had reached Mysuru in early January.

Identifying himself as Rafiq, Ravi befriended a tea vendor and his daughter. The girl eloped with `Rafiq' on January 6. The girl was abused during the journey and at Ravi's house. Later, the girl telephoned her father, who had filed a missing complaint on January 7. Police got Ravi's address after questioning several truck drivers.
