Molestation
Description:
			Four youths allegedly forced a girl into their car and attempted to molest her at Byatarayanapura on Mysore Road.

The girl, a diploma student in a private college, befriended one of the youths on a social networking site. He had invited her for a trip to Mysore and asked her to join him near Mysore Road. Around 12.30 pm, she went to the spot and upon finding three more men in the car, refused to get in. However, the youth forced her in and allegedly tried to molest her.

Panicking, the girl called her elder sister, who then alerted the police control room. Meanwhile, the miscreants managed to escape when some locals approached the car. The girl then went to the police station. She, however, refused to file a complaint.

A senior police officer said they suspect that one of the youths was her lover.
