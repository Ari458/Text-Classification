Abduction
Description:
			Showing a remarkable presence of mind and courage, a 10 years old girl thwarted a kidnapping attempt by jumping out of a moving van.

The police later nabbed a 38-year-old man, a driver by profession.

According to Dongri police in south Mumbai, the girl (name not disclosed) was awaiting her school van outside her house in Char-nal area when Raju Mehboob Khan drove to the spot in an Omni, and asked her to get in.

As it was not her usual school van, the girl initially refused, but he told her that it was a substitute vehicle as the regular van had broken down.

The girl got in, but realised something was wrong when Khan took a wrong turn. Getting suspicious, the girl jumped out.

As bystanders came to her help, a car driver gave chase to Khan until he hit the CST-Chembur Freeway, and then alerted the Police Control, giving them the van's registration number.

Police found the van abandoned in Chembur. In the van they found a visiting card and when we dialled the number, a lady, the owner, answered and confirmed that it was her van and it was with the her driver.

A police team went to her house and asked her to summon Khan. He arrived and was arrested after the girl identified him.
