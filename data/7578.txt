Description:
			Police here on Sunday booked a city resident for allegedly raping his stepdaughter. The accused, an employee of the Food Corporation of India (FCI), is on the run.

The complainant is 16 years old and her mother is lodged in prison in connection with another rape case. In her complaint, the victim said her father died when she was just a few days old, and her mother married the accused when she was not even a year old.

The rape survivor has alleged that a day before Diwali last year, the accused raped her when the two were alone. He allegedly threatened her with "dire consequences" if she told anyone about the incident.

It was on Sunday that the victim mustered up courage and approached the police. The police have booked the accused, whose name has been withheld to protect the identity of the rape survivor, under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and Protection of Children Against Sexual Offences Act.

Jaspal Singh, investigating officer, said the accused is on the run. "Efforts are on to nab him. The medical examination of the complainant will be done at the civil hospital on Monday," he said.
