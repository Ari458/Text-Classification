Molestation, Street Harassment
Description:
			There was a ruckus at a prominent grocery store at Rajendra Nagar in central Delhi when a model whipped out her pistol after allegedly being molested by two men.

Around 9am, the woman went to a retail outlet near Karol Bagh along with her friends. In her statement to police she said the men molested her when she was awaiting billing. "She told us that the duo also passed lewd comments and tried to touch her inappropriately after which she pulled out the pistol from her handbag. The accused fled after storekeepers tried to intervene," said a senior policed official.

Police have procured CCTV footage to verify the case and identify the men. The model has also been asked to join the probe.

"A case has been registered at the Rajendra Nagar police station and we have asked the woman to identify the accused. We are awaiting her response. No arrests or detentions have been made so far," said Parmaditya, DCP, central. Police will check for her licence for keeping the weapon as they suspected it to be an air pistol.

Last month, the model allegedly misbehaved with the staff of a five-star hotel in Dwarka when she was asked to pay her bills. Two days after the incident, she had posted a video on a social networking site warning the media to sue them for Rs 1,000 crore for maligning her.
