Description:
			Three college students were recently arrested by the Dadar police on charges of raping a minor, and clicking her obscene photos and making an obscene video of her on mobile phone.

According to the police, the accused are known to the victim as they all stay in the same neighbourhood.

In August 2014, the victim had gone to a college in Mahalaxmi to meet a friend. Two days later she received a phone call on her mobile phone and the caller identified himself as Ajay Patel, who is known to the victim. He told her that he wanted to become her friend. They soon began talking regularly over the phone, the police said.

"In September, Patel called the victim to a hotel in Nalasopara. There, he told her that he loves her, and later they got physical. In October, he called the victim to his residence and they had intercourse again," said an officer.

He added that while Patel and the victim were in a compromising position, Patel's friend Kapil Kamble clicked their photograph. "Two months later, Kamble called up the victim and told her that he has her photograph with Patel. He demanded that she get physical with him too, threatening to make the photo public if she refused. The victim gave in to Kamble's demand. When the victim was with Kamble, the latter's friend Fredrick Periera shot a video of them on his mobile phone," the officer said.

As per the victim, Periera too threatened her to get physical with him. "The victim then confided in her mother what had happened, after which a complaint was lodged at Dadar police station on May 22. Based on the complaint, we arrested the three. We have seized their mobile phones, but the trio has deleted the obscene photographs and clip from the phones. Their phones have been sent to the forensic department for retrieval of data," said senior inspector Nishikant Patil.
