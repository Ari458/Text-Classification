			A local court awarded 10-year jail term along with a fine of Rs 20,000 each to a husband and his mother in a dowry death case here today.
The Mohali Court of Additional District and Session Judge sent Jaswinder Singh and his mother, Naib Kaur, both residents of Bartana, to jail for 10 years in a case of dowry death of Jaswinder Singh's wife Sandip Kaur.

Sandip Kaur had died on the intervening night of September 7 and 8 in 2013 at her in-laws house. A case in this regard was registered on the complaint of the victim's father, Karamjit Singh, under Sections 304-B and 498-A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) at the Lalru police station.

The victim had got married to the accused on February 6, 2010, but she returned to her parents' house after three months of the marriage following some dispute. The dispute was said to be solved later and she returned to her husband's house. The victim's father had alleged that she died because of strangulation with her dupatta.
