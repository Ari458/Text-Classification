Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A 14-year-old girl, a resident of Dumdum in Kolkata setting out to meet her Facebook friend without informing her parents, was allegedly raped by three Army men in Amritsar-bound Howrah-Amritsar Express on Monday morning. Police have arrested one Army man, who had allegedly forced the girl to take alcohol.

Madhupur Government Railway Police (GRP) Arjun Tiwari said the girl had wrongly entered a compartment reserved for Army men. Arrested Army man Mandrish Tripathi had reportedly forced the girl to drink liquor. She was allegedly raped when she had gone to toilet. We got information about a girl being in unconscious condition in train. We admitted her to hospital. She has been in a state of shock. We learnt that she is from Dumdum and is from a well-to-do family. Her father had alerted Kolkata GRP as soon as she left her home on Sunday,said Tiwari.

It was a group of social workers that first noticed the girl being unconscious in the train at Madhupur. The Madhupur GRP quizzed the Army men aboard the train and arrested Mandrish Tripathi, a resident of Sultanpur in UP.

The police said the Dumdum girl, who had been insisting on meeting her Facebook friend from Ludhiana, had rebelled against family and left home to meet her friend without permission. The class nine girl had boarded the train at Howrah at 1.50 pm on Sunday. The victim told the police that she was raped six times after being threatened.

Madhupur sub-divisional police officer Ashok Kumar Singh said that FIR was registered after her medical examination was conducted. The SDPO said that her Facebook chat showed that the girl had been going to meet her Facebook boyfriend, who has been identified.
