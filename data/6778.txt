Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			The father and uncle of a 17-year-old student in Gurgaon were arrested on Friday on charges of raping her repeatedly over a period of three years. The accused were arrested on Friday morning.

The matter was reported to police after the girl, a Class XII student of a private school in Gurgaon, called childline (1098) on Thursday and informed them about the alleged abuse.
The father is a government teacher in a senior secondary school and the uncle is a manager of a private bank in Gurgaon. The medical examination at Civil Hospital confirmed rape, police said.

The girl's statement was recorded by the duty magistrate under Section 164 CrPC on Friday.
According to police, the girl called the helpline on Thursday as she was too scared to speak to anyone else. She was immediately taken to police where a complaint was registered against the two men.

ACP (Crime) Rajesh Kumar said, Her father, a government teacher, aged 44, allegedly raped her several times. She alleged that her uncle also raped her for three years since when she was a Class VI student.

Police said the abuse took place whenever she was alone at home. The first incident took place in 2009 when her uncle (aunt's husband) raped her after finding her alone at home. Soon after, her father also started raping her. After that it became a frequent practice, police said. The men would get together at her house for drinks and then rape her. Initially, she kept mum but in 2011, she informed her mother.

The victim was confident that after she complained about her uncle to her mother, things would change and that he would be asked not to visit their house. But to her shock, she was scolded and was asked not to discuss the matter with anyone. The girl started getting depressed,Kumar said.

Police said the girl's studies were also affected over the last few years.
