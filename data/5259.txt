Description:
			A 22-year-old woman was allegedly abducted and gang raped by her relative and his two accomplices in the district.

The woman, a resident of Ghanshyampur village under Patwai Police Station of Rampur district, claimed that her relative wished to marry her and without her consent he obtained a fake marriage certificate in their name, Rampur Superintendent of Police Sadhna Goswami said.

In her complaint, the woman alleged that the accused along with two of his accomplices abducted her from her house on Wednesday and forcibly took her in a car to Rudrapur town of neighbouring Uttrakhand, where she was gang raped by the trio in a house and illegally confined there.

The woman managed to flee from the spot and approached Patwai Police to file a complaint in this regard but she claimed that the police did not register her complaint following which she approached the SP yesterday.

Goswami has directed the Patwai Police SHO to register the woman's complaint and proceed with necessary action against the three accused.
