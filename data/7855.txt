Domestic Violence, Dowry Harassment
Description:
			Tamil film actor Kreshna of Kazhugu fame was booked under the dowry harassment charge by the Coimbatore district police on Wednesday in response to a complaint by his wife.

Krishna, brother of Billa director Vishnuvardhan, was married to K Hemalatha alias Kaivalya (29) from Pethikuttai, Sirumugai. They came to know each other through Facebook and got married on February 6 last year at Mettupalayam.

In June, Hemalatha lodged a complaint against her husband with the Coimbatore district Superintendent of Police M Sudhakar, who forwarded it to Thudiyalur All Women Police Station for inquiry and action.

In her complaint Hemalatha said, "During the marriage, actor Kreshna and his family members demanded 300 sovereigns of gold jewellery and `32 lakh cash as dowry. We gave 118 sovereign of gold jewellery and `35 lakh cash, but Kreshna and his family members tortured me demanding the balance jewellery."

Acting on her complaint, police on Wednesday registered a case against Kreshna, his father K Gunasekaran (66) and his mother G Madhubala (62) for subjecting a woman to cruelty, criminal breach of trust and criminal intimidation.

"In her petition, she also alleged that the actor had extramarital affairs with a woman who acted in one of his films. Despite our repeated calls, Kreshna failed to appear before us for inquiry and did not cooperate with the probe. In light of the Supreme Court ruling, we will not arrest the actor and will be filing the charge sheet in court," said a police officer.

On the delay in filing an FIR, the officer said, "We have to follow the procedure. The complaint was first forwarded to the Social Welfare department for inquiry and only later we started our probe and filed a case."

Kreshna has already filed a divorce petition in a Chennai family court alleging physical and verbal abuse by his wife.
