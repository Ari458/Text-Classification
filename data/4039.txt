Child Sexual Abuse, Molestation, Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			A wrestling coach has been booked under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act in Hisar for alleged sexual harassment of players.

The accused, Satbir Panghal, a Sports Authority of India coach, has been booked by Hisar police after receiving complaints from six minor girls who were training under him.

This is a huge embarrassment for Haryana, a state known for producing top sports persons, and is perhaps the first case in the state of a senior sports coach being booked under the recently implemented POCSO Act, which aims at protecting children (individuals below the age of 18) from sexual violence.

An FIR against the coach was registered. A family member of one of the girls said the coach used to touch the girls intimately on the pretext of checking their dresses.

He further alleged Panghal had kissed the girls on 'Kissing Day'. These allegations were part of the police complaint submitted by the girls.

The 57-year-old coach vehemently denied the allegations saying it was a conspiracy. Panghal said the girls weren't performing well and he had prepared a report to weed them out of SAI's training programme. A colleague knew about the report and informed the girls, who have now come up with baseless charges.
