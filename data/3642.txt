Murder
Description:
			Mutilated body of a seven-year-old tribal girl, was found at Mathalput in Koraput district of Odisha triggering tension in the area.

Villagers blocked the road near Mathalput, which leads to Damanjodi, for several hours after the body was found, demanding immediate arrest of the culprits and adequate compensation to the family of the Class I student, who was suspected to have been killed by some sorcerer.

The girl went to play with her friends after returning from school. Her family lodged a missing person complaint at Damanjodi police station after failing to locate her.

The girl's tongue was slit and her body bore several burn scars, which indicate that she was killed by some sorcerer. We demand adequate compensation to the bereaved family.

A team of police are probing the matter from all angles.

It could be a case of sorcery, but can't conclude anything at this stage
