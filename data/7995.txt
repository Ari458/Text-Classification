Molestation
Description:
			In a shocking incident, a man attacked his brothers wife for complaining that he was sexually harassing her at S.Kota in Vizianagaram. Later, he committed suicide by cutting his wrists with a blade fearing that he would be jailed.

According to sources, P Babu Rao of Musidipalli village of the same mandal had been harassing his younger brother Lakshmana Raos wife Kripa for sexual favours. She refused to oblige and warned him many times. She even intimated her parents, who also warned him. But there was no change in the behaviour of Babu Rao, who continued to bother her.

Frustrated, Kripa recently complained to the police about her brother-in-laws harassment, after which he went absconding. On Sunday, an angry Babu Rao entered the house and slit her throat. Scared that he would be landing behind bars, Babu slit his own hands and throat with a blade from his home. Though Babu died of bleeding, Kripa was rushed to the hospital by her family. She is undergoing treatment at KGH here and is in a critical condition. Police are investigating.
