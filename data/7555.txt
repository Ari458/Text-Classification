Description:
			Around a decade after a woman torched herself because of dowry harassment, a city court here has sentenced her husband and mother-in-law to 10 years RI. 

According to the prosecution, 27-year-old Arun Maharaj of Old Washermenpet, married Krishnakumari, 24, of Vilathikulam in May 2001. Krishnakumari's family had provided 18 sovereigns gold as dowry. Few months after the marriage, Maharaj along with her mother Veena, 45 asked Krishnakumari to bring more cash and jewelry as dowry. Krishnakumari, however, bore it silently thinking things would improve after some time. She gave birth to a girl and a boy. But, the duo continued harassing Krishnakumari for dowry. She set herself ablaze in 2005. 

Based on a complaint from her family, Tondiarpet police registered a case under sections 489-A (punishment for subjecting a woman to cruelty), 306 (abetting the commission of suicide) and 304-B (dowry death) of the IPC. 

When the matter came for pronouncing orders, Mahila court judge, Meena Sathish said the prosecution had proved the charges against the duo beyond a reasonable doubt. Sentencing them, the court also slapped them with a fine of Rs 15,000 each.
