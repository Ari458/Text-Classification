Crime, Rape
Description:
			Two minor girls were raped beside a temple and the perpetrators happen to be none other than their own family members. Although both the accused have been arrested and remanded to judicial custody, the entire village is still shocked.

Two girls aged 12 and 14 and natives of Sheikhodaura village in Nawada district, where the late Socialist leader Jayaprakash Narayan had stayed at an ashram in the mid-1950s, were returning after attending a marriage ceremony. As they neared Baba Bholenath temple, two of their relatives, 20-year-old Ajay Ravidas, the cousin of one of the victims, and Neeraj Ravidas, the uncle of the other victim, grabbed both the girls in semi-darkness and raped them.

After an FIR was lodged by the victims and their statement recorded under Section 164 of the CrPC in Nawada court, the two accused were forwarded to jail. The girls also underwent the mandatory medical examination at sadar hospital. The medical report is awaited.
