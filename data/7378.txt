The victims were in their house when the assailant, Amit Kumar, who is known to the family, came to their house and knocked the door. Yamini opened the door and on finding Amit asked as to what he wanted.

“After some argument with Yamini, Amit took out a utility knife and inflicted wounds on her resulting in bleeding injuries. As the woman ran out of the house to seek help from the tenants, Amit walked into the house and attacked Srilekha with the same weapon,” an investigation officer said.

A person who stays on the first floor of the house came down on hearing the commotion. He entered the house and caught Amit, but the latter pushed him and walked out of the house, the officer added. Their mother Sangireddy Hymavathi left the house at around 8.15 a.m for job.
