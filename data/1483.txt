Rape
Description:
			Santosh Jagtap (25), a resident of DAD complex, on Bibvewadi-Kondhwa road was sentenced to 10 years rigorous imprisonment for raping an 11-year-old girl in 2010. 

The victim was a student of standard five when she was raped by the accused behind the CGHS out-patient hospital at Market Yard on September 18, 2010. The accused had threatened the victim that he would kidnap her two-year-old sister if she told anyone of the incident.

On October 5, 2010, a magisterial court cancelled his bail on a police report stating that the victim had given a statement saying that she was raped. 

Additional public prosecutor Neelima Vartak examined 10 witnesses and relied on evidence given by the victim, her mother, medical officer and assistant police inspector Varsha Rani Patil for proving the guilt of the accused.
