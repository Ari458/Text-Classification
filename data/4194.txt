Description:
			A Delhi court today fixed February 24 for pronouncing its order on framing of charges against BSP MP Dhananjay Singh who has been accused of raping a 42-year-old woman for nearly four years.

Additional Sessions Judge Sarita Birbal fixed February 24 for pronouncement of order on whether to frame charges in the case and also on the bail plea of Singh after concluding hearing of arguments of the prosecution and the defence counsel.

During arguments on framing of charges against Singh, a sitting MP from Jaunpur constituency in Uttar Pradesh, the police said they have the evidence which shows the involvement of the accused in the crime.

It said the forensic and medical reports of the victim corroborated the statement given by her before a magistrate under Section 164 of the CrPC.

The police said the victim has given all the details of the incident in her statement under 164 CrPC.

Senior advocate Hariharan and advocate S P M Tripathi, who appeared for Singh, said there were inconsistency and improvement in the statement of the alleged victim and police cannot solely rely on her statement.

During the hearing on the bail plea of Singh who is in judicial custody, his counsel said the charge sheet has already been filed in the case and the probe is also complete so there was no need to keep the MP in custody.

His bail plea was opposed by the police which said the court is yet to frame charges against him and, if released, he can influence the witnesses, including the victim, and can tamper with the evidence.

The matter was earlier transferred to the sessions court after a magisterial court had taken cognisance of the charge sheet filed by Delhi Police against Singh.
