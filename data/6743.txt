Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			The Dharavi police have launched a manhunt for three men who are wanted for the kidnap of a 16-year-old girl from Nagpada on Sunday night. The girl said that two of the men had raped her, and the third is her boyfriend. The Dharavi police patrol vehicle spotted the girl roaming on the streets of Dharavi, after which the entire incident came to light.

According to the Dharavi police, the girl lives with her mother on a footpath near Sagar hotel at Nagpada. The girl told the police that on Sunday evening, she had gone to meet her boyfriend, whom she identified as Imtiaz, at Mastan Talav in Nagpada.

Inspector SM Jadhav from Dharavi police said that Imtiaz, whom the girl knew for a year, took her for a joyride and dropped her at an unknown place, telling her to wait for him there. Imtiaz never returned.

PI Jadhav added: "While the girl was waiting, two of the accused, whom she did not know, approached and told her that her boyfriend wouldn't come back. They asked her to accompany them, saying that they would drop her back to Nagpada."

After hailing a taxi to Dharavi, the duo walked the girl to Nisarg garden there. The police informed that the garden's wall was partly broken, so the duo took the girl inside and raped her.

"After raping her, the accused left the girl in the garden and fled. Somehow, she managed to get to the main road, where a police patrol vehicle spotted her in bruised condition. The cops on duty brought her to the police station, after which she revealed her ordeal," said PI Jadhav.

The Dharavi police registered a case of kidnapping and gang rape, and send the girl for a medical examination. "We are currently trying to locate her mother. The girl is in a state of shock, and we will get a sketch prepared once she is stable," added the inspector.
