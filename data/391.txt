Description:
			A woman belonging to the minority community stood steadfast against society when her husband "sold" her to another man for money and she was repeatedly raped for three long months. The local panchayat remained mute when her in-laws openly stripped her and her hair was cut. The patience of the semi-literate woman ended when her two-year-old daughter was snatched and taken to Raipur for child marriage. She went to Beawar police station and a case is registered against 24 villagers for dowry harassment, rape and "selling" a woman. 

According to the victim, she was married to Sabeer son of Nemaji Kathat, resident of a remote village Gunda ka Bala of Beawer block on April 15, 2006. "They harassed me and demanded I bring money from my father as Sabeer wanted to start a new business," she said. Her in-laws were enraged when she gave birth to a girl and demanded money to bring-up the girl in their house, she added. 

"My husband sold me to Ajad, son of Roshan of the same village on June 12, 2011 and he took me to a house where Ajad locked me and raped me for three months" she cried. She was freed in first week of September when she returned to her husband. 

"They called a panchayat and stripped me accusing me of being characterless, blackened my face and cut my hairs," the victim told TOI in tears.
