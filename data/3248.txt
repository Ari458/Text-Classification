Description:
			Three women, including a school headmistress, were arrested for their alleged role in assaulting and disrobing a woman on the street on September 29. Another woman suspect has been detained for interrogation.

The arrested trio, Rumi Lohar, 40, Marjina Begum, 55, and Paramjit Kaur, 31, all hail from the victim's locality, Nagaon. Lohar is the headmistress of Bagisha LP School.

A 40-personnel police team, including 30 policewomen, led by officer-in-charge of Golaghat police station H.K. Dohutia, launched the hunt in Nagaon, on the periphery of the town. As the police launched the raid, most women fled their houses.

The police have arrested three accused so far but the search for about 15 others is on. The accused have been produced in court and sent to judicial custody for two weeks. We have left no stone unturned to bring the culprits to book.

The police could not conduct the raid because of the Sonowal Kachari Autonomous Council election.

The victim, who is yet to recover from the mob attack, was hardly able to talk when the correspondent visited her house. Her motor-mechanic husband, who had filed an FIR, was with her.

A mob of nearly hundred people, primarily women, allegedly entered the 38-year-old victim's house, dragged her out in the street, disrobed her, cut her hair and assaulted her.

The mob was enraged as the victim had lodged an FIR against Satpal Singh, who used to teach her minor son, alleging he had tried to outrage her modesty.

Singh, who was arrested, is in judicial custody. His mother is said to have died, as she could not bear her son's plight. This triggered the mob retaliation.
