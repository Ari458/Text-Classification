Domestic Violence, Murder, Dowry Harassment
Description:
			An eight-month pregnant woman was allegedly thrashed to death by her husband and parents-in-law in Khamaria Mahadia village on Monday night as their demand for Rs two lakh and a motorcycle in dowry was not met.

An FIR has been lodged against the suspects, who are absconding. The FIR in the case was lodged by the victim Babli's father Shanti Swaroop. According to the FIR, Babli (22), a resident of Saijana village, married Rambabu two years ago. She was tortured by her husband and his parents over their dowry demands.

As Swaroop was unable to meet the demands, he urged Babli's in-laws to mend their ways, but to no avail. On Monday night, Rambabu, Babli's father-in-law Pothi Ram and mother-in-law Jashoda Devi allegedly beat her to death, the FIR says.
