Rape
Description:
			The Rajasansi police have booked a resident of Adliwal village on the charge of raping a married woman. Though the incident occurred over a month ago, a complaint was lodged with the police only yesterday evening.

The 26-year-old victim stated to the police her husband had been living in Dubai. She alleged on November 21, she was alone in her room when the accused entered her room. He bolted the door and covered her mouth. She alleged that he raped her.

She said she somehow raised the alarm following which a relative came to the house and the accused fled. She said she did not tell anyone or lodge any complaint due to the fear of social stigma. She said a few days ago, her husband returned from Dubai and she narrated the whole incident to him who asked her to lodge a police complaint.
