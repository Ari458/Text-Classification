Rape
Description:
			A 17-year-old girl was allegedly raped at gunpoint in a computer training centre in Habibpur village.

Zakir, an employee at the centre where the victim was enrolled, raped the girl on June 8 and threatened to kill her if she told anyone about the incident.

The accused had allegedly asked the victim to stay back and committed the crime after all other students had left.

Two days after the incident, the girl had stopped going to the centre as she could not face the accused who again threatened her.

The victim went into depression and it was only recently that she confided in her parents about the incident.
