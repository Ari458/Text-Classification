Description:
			The Mangala Bhatt's eyes brimmed with tears as she recalled the outrage she felt when her tormentor, principal Rajiv Kumar Singh, touched her inappropriately and pushed her in full view of a maid, peon and others. And this was not the only time. This 30-year-old mother of a five-year-old alleged that she had been at the receiving end, over several months, of Dr. Singh's lewd comments and open invitation to meet him outside the school if she wanted to be made permanent in her contractual job.

Ms. Bhatt wants justice also for all teachers, helpers and peons whose services have been terminated. With such a principal at the helm of affairs what will be the future of children? Other women should come up and speak out. I could, because of the support of my husband.
