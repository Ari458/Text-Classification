Street Harassment
Description:
			Locals thrashed a youth allegedly after an eve-teasing incident at Badla Chauraha area in Bhilwara on Sunday afternoon.

After thrashing the youth, the angry mob also shaved his head to teach him a lesson.

According to the police, some people informed them that a youth, identified as Beethal, was allegedly teasing a girl and so people thrashed him in the market.

"He was badly beaten up by the locals who had also shaved his head. Our team rushed to the spot but neither the victim girl nor the alleged youth said or complained about the matter," said a senior officer of the Kotwali police station in Bhilwara.

The police confirmed that people had thrashed and shaved a youth, but the reason why people took the law into their hands was not clear.

"We are taking inputs from the market traders and others to investigate the case," said an officer.

The youth, after being thrashed, later fled the spot. "When our team visited the spot, neither the youth nor any other witness was found," said the officer.

The police added that the youth had already fled the scene when locals informed him that he would be handed over to the police.
