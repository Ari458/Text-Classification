Abuse
Description:
			Fear of reprimand by her parents and concerns about the family's image kept the girl from reporting the crime for two days. She finally revealed it when the accused friend and other perpetrators came to her home in Jaripatka and abused her on Thursday evening. The victim told of the incident to her parents who then encouraged her to lodge a complaint.
