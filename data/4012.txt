Abduction, Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A youth accused of raping a 12-year-old girl has been sent to seven years in jail by a Delhi court which said his act was "well planned and well deliberated upon". 

The court awarded jail term to 23-year-old Ramnek Yadav, a native of Bihar, observing that he took undue advantage of the victim's tender age and subjected her to his sexual lust several times after forcibly taking her signatures on documents and declaring that they were husband and wife.

The convict (Yadav) has ruined the life of an innocent minor girl by ravishing her after taking her to his native village in Bihar. It is manifest that the convict had nurtured an intention to satisfy his sexual lust upon her and it is for this reason that he took her to his native village. 

The act of the convict seems to be well planned and well deliberated upon. The crime committed by the convict is intensely grave and serious in nature. 

The court also imposed a fine of Rs 10,000 on Yadav and said if realised, the amount should be given to the victim. 

According to the prosecution, the girl had met Yadav at her mother's tea stall in July 2011 and became friends with her. He used to persuade her to marry him and in August, 2011, he took her to his friend's place and thereafter to Bihar for marrying her. 

Yadav confined the minor victim at several places in Bihar, including his house, and used to physically assault and rape her, the girl was rescued from Madhavpur village in Bihar by the police after two months and they were brought to Delhi. 

During her medical test, the girl was found to be pregnant and her pregnancy was terminated with her consent.
