Description:
			Crime branch officials in the city nabbed a youth from Gandhidham on Friday for uploading indecent photographs of a girl on a fake profile on Facebook. 

Investigation revealed that the two had been classmates in school and the youth was interested in the girl since then. However, it appeared to be a case of one-sided love.

Swearing vengeance for 'breaking his heart', the youth floated a fake profile of the girl and started posting her images and personal information.
