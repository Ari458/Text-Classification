Child Sexual Abuse, Murder, Rape
Description:
			In 2006, V Selvam raped and murdered 10 year old daughter of his employer, dumped her body in a carton and hid it in the house. A few days later, the body was discovered. Selvam was arrested and the (Women's)Mahila Court imposed a death penalty on him on August 1, 2008, along with 10 years of rigorous imprisonment for house trespass and rape, 10 years for unnatural offences and seven years for causing disappearance of evidence. 

Selvam filed an appeal at the High Court bench here, claiming that his date of birth is June 1, 1989 and therefore was a juvenile at the time of the offence.
