Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			The police have arrested a 48-year-old Malad man on the charge of raping an 8-year-old girl from his neighbourhood. Mohammed Younus Khan allegedly committed the crime on January 16 in Gate number 8 in Malwani. Both the accused and the child are known to each other, said the police.

The minor was attacked when she was alone at her home. "When Khan visited the girl's place, he found her parents away. He sexually assaulted her and threatened to harm her if she told about it to anyone," said Prakash Patil, senior inspector of Malwani police station.

The girl became silent for a while, but later broke down in front of her mother on Saturday, saying she her private part was bruised and she was experiencing pain. When her mother probed further, the child narrated the crime.

"After the girl's mother informed her husband and other neighbours about the rape, the residents of the area caught Khan and started thrashing him. After we were informed about the ruckus at Gate number 8, we reached the spot and took Khan under our custody around 2 am on Sunday," said Patil, adding that Khan worked as a labourer and is a father of four girls.

While the child was sent for a medical examination, cops booked Khan under section 376 (rape) of the Indian Penal Code and under relevant sections of the Protection of Children from sexual Offences (POCSO) Act – the charges entail a maximum punishment of life imprisonment.

A holiday court on Sunday remanded Khan in police custody till January 23. There are no previous records of crime against the accused, said the police.
