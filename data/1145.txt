Description:
			On December 31, the accused called up the minor at her residence and informed her that he was at work and would soon be coming to pick her up from Porvorim. "He said that he would take her to Betim to purchase a new cycle that she had been wanting since long. Accordingly, the girl met him at 7.15pm at Porvorim. The girl's parents also didn't suspect anything as the accused was close to the family," police said.

The accused instead of taking the minor to the cycle shop took her to an isolated spot at Betim. "He then took her to the bushes and then forcibly pushed her down. When the victim raised an alarm, he pulled out a knife and threatened her with dire consequences. He then molested the victim and even threatened her with dire consequences," the police said.
