Domestic Violence, Rape
Description:
			A 36-year-old woman from Shahpur accused her husband of rape and brutality in a complaint with Shahpur police. Police investigators have sent the woman for medical investigation on Saturday and started a search for the accused. 

According to Shahpur police, Samina (name changed), 36, a resident of a flat in Mirzapur, married Salim (name changed) three months ago. It was Samina's second marriage and she came to live with Salim with her three children. Salim works at a readymade garments shop in the Walled City. 

"In her complaint, she says she was not feeling well on Friday and went to sleep early. Her husband came home late from work and demanded sex. When she refused to cooperate, Salim raped her. The ordeal continued on Saturday morning as when the children went to school, Salim again demanded sex at 7.45 am," said a Shahpur police officer. 

Samina tried to reason with Salim, who then got enraged and threatened her with a hot knife and stripped her. He then allegedly tied her hands and legs with strips of cloth to a bed and then allegedly put chilli powder on her private parts. He then locked her and left. 

R S Patel, inspector of Shahpur police station, said that she untied herself with great effort and then provided an extra key to the neighbours who had gathered outside her flat. "We hope to get the medical report for the rape and brutality by Sunday and that will be evidence against the accused. We are searching for him to ascertain what happened. We are also trying to contact family members from both sides to learn more about the relationship of the couple," said Patel.
