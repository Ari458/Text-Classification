Dowry Harassment
Description:
			A case of dowry death was registered against software professional of a reputed company on Friday after his wife committed suicide in their flat at Miyapur allegedly due to harassment for dowry.

Twenty-six-year-old Anoosha ended her life by hanging in her flat at Pragathi Enclave the previous day. A note purportedly written by her stated that nobody was responsible for her death. Her parents, however, charged that her husband Yashwanth Kumar had been harassing her for quite some time and demanding additional dowry.
