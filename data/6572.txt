Murder
Description:
			A 25-year-old woman was strangled to death by her husband in their Uttar Nagar residence in West Delhi, police said.

The accused, identified as Mohammed Shahid, was arrested today and a case of murder has been registered against him at the Uttam Nagar Police Station.

The victim is identified as Zubain and a complaint in this connection was filed by her brother, police said.

The incident came to light when the brother came to visit her, identified as Zubain, and she did not take the call following which the brother, suspecting a foul play, broke open the door with the help of neighbours and found Zubain dead and wrapped inside a quilt.

"The brother alerted the police. Initial investigation revealed death due to suffocation," a senior police official said.

Locals had seen Zubain's husband, Mohammed Shahid, leaving the house hurriedly along with their two children following which Shahid was detained from his sister's house in the nearby area.

"During interrogation, Shahid admitted to the murder and said that he suspected his wife of having an affair with his neighbour," the officer said.

"Last evening Shahid and Zubain had an argument over the latter's alleged affair during which Zubain threatened to report the matter to her family members. Her husband then strangled her in a fit of rage," the officer added.

Shahid first wrapped Zubain's body in a quilt and then fled from the spot to her sister's house.

Their two children aged 5 and 7 have been handed over to the family members.
