Description:
			The family of a 15-year-old girl, who was raped by a youth of her village in Gomia block of the district on Sunday morning, lodged an FIR with Chatro Chatti police station later in the day.
After the incident, the villagers organized a panchayat and ordered the accused to marry the victim. However, the accused's family refused to marry off their son to the girl.

Police on Monday took the girl for a medical examination while officer in-charge P C Devgam said the victim's statement will be recorded under section 164 of CrPC before a judicial magistrate on Tuesday. The girl, a class IX student of a government school who was living with her maternal uncle, is currently in a state of shock.

The accused, Mukesh Mahto (25), is son of a ward member from the village. The girl told police that she had gone to relieve herself when the accused attacked her from behind. She added that he dragged her to a nearby farm area and raped her.

After Mahto left the spot, the girl rushed home and told her maternal uncle about the incident. The villagers gathered and launched a search for Mahto, but failed to find him. The panchayat was called to discuss the matter. The father of the accused, Jeevlal Mahto, was asked to attend the meet. The panchayat ordered Jeevlal to solemnize the marriage of his son with the victim, but the latter refused.

Bermo DSP Neeraj Kumar said that the victim's family was in fear as the accused belongs to an affluent family. The man's family has asked the victim and her family to not worry. Police are on the lookout for the accused. "The victim came to us after she failed to get justice during the meet. If the victim's family informed us earlier, we would have launched a search operation and nabbed the accused," said Kumar.
