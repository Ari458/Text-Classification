Rape, Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			Anil Mahabole, an Assistant Commissioner of police, was on Tuesday charged with raping a woman inspector who resides at Kurla in central Mumbai. 

The FIR was filed by the victim who accused ACP Anil Mahabole of raping her after offering her food laced with sedatives.

The victim had approached Joint Commissioner of Police (Law and Order) Rajnesh Seth and Jt CP (Crime) Himanshu Roy last week, alleging that Mahabole raped her several times. 

She alleged that Mahabole visited her Kurla house and offered her sweets laced with intoxicants, which made her unconscious. The victim had further alleged that Mahabole raped her after that and also made an MMS clip of her. 

"Mahabole then blackmailed her to continue having physical relations with her. He also paid her regular visits in the absence of her husband and raped her repeatedly," an officer from Mumbai's Azad Maidan police station said.
