Description:
			A retired carpenter was arrested on the charge of sexually harassing two minor girls in his house at Kattur on the city’s outskirts recently.

The accused Y. Arokiadas, 67, was arrested and subsequently remanded on a complaint preferred by the mother of one of the minor girls.

Police sources said Arokiadas under the pretext of teaching mathematics to the two minor girls – aged 10 years and nine years - had sexually harassed them and threatened not to disclose the matter.

The issue came to light after the mother of one of the girls found teeth marks in the chest of her daughter while giving her a bath.

The girl reportedly disclosed the offence committed by the aged man.

A complaint was lodged to the Tiruverambur All Women Police leading to the arrest of Arokiadas. Police said Arokiadas had been staying alone after his wife left him.

His five daughters were married and settled while his son was pursuing higher education.
