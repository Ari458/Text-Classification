Dowry Harassment
Description:
			Sanjeev Dahiya (30) married Reena on November 24, 2005. The relations between the couple had turned sour after Dahiya and his family members had allegedly started demanding dowry, such as a plot to construct a house, a car and money. Reena's brother Satish Kumar, who was present in the court, claimed that his family had given Dahiya Rs 5 lakh in a fixed deposit and a motorcycle at the time of the marriage, but Reena was still being harassed by her husband and others over dowry demands.

Kumar alleged that his sister was starved and ill-treated physically and mentally, following which she lodged a complaint against Dahiya and his family members with the Nanakpura police station in New Delhi on August 16, 2008.
