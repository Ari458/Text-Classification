Rape, Street Harassment
Description:
			A newly married Mahadalit woman was gang-raped by four men on the outskirts of Karisath village in Bhojpur district around Saturday midnight. Taking swift action, police on Sunday arrested three persons in this connection. 

The three have been identified as Indu Dom and Jaiky Dom of Town police station area, and Bhola Ram of Maula Bagh locality under the same police station area. They were later sent to jail. Police brought the woman to Ara sadar hospital for medical examination. Police are searching for two others involved in the incident. 

According to the complaint lodged with woman police station here, Reena Kharwar (name changed), a resident of Bihia in the district, got down from a passenger train at Jagjivan Halt, about 4 km from Ara railway station, late on Saturday evening and reached Chandwa under Nawada police station area. Five persons were following her en route Chandwa, who forcibly took her to a field near Karisath village and four of them outraged her modesty one by one, the complaint said. The woman reached Ara in the wee hours of Sunday and narrated her ordeal to a mobile police party, which took her to Nawada police station. 

SDPO Binod Kumar Raut said the woman got down from a train at Jagjivan halt and reached Chandwa on foot. "The five miscreants followed her. Seeing them, the woman complained to a mobile police team there that the miscreants were chasing her. The police team shooed away the miscreants and hired a three-wheeler to take her to Karisath. After the police team left the place, the miscreants forcibly boarded the same three-wheeler, took her to Karisath and gang-raped her in a field," he said. 

The accused, however, said all of them, including the woman, are luggage-lifters. The woman had snatched a chain from a passenger and they were demanding their share in the booty but she refused and instead implicated them in the false case of rape, they said.
