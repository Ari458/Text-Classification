Description:
			Halima(65), from Thane's Rabodi locality, was attacked by 40-year-old Akbar Shaikh after she refused to give in to his demand of vacating the house in which she lives with her daughter Saira.

According to daughter Saira, "My mother and I started living in a separate house about 17 yrs ago, while my father Sikander Shaikh and brother Akbar stayed at our old place because Akbar and my mother would fight all the time", Saira said. Even here, she's been attacked on several occasions for refusing to give Akbar money.
