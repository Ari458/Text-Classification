Molestation, Rape, Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			City Mahila police station has booked three persons for raping, blackmailing and molesting a woman. The accused include a woman, who allegedly helped in the crime. 

According to the victim's complaint, accused Suresh Patel had raped her repeatedly between 2008 and 2009 and had filmed the act on a video camera to blackmail her to continue the physical relationship with him. 

"The victim, who is a 40-year-old woman and native of Morbi, says that she had come to Rajkot in 2008 and was living with her husband and kids in Dhebar Colony. That time a woman named Meena Pujara had got her a job as a sweeper in Patel's Surya Shakti Electric Shop in Narayannagar-7. Meena asked the victim to have physical relations with Patel, luring her with Patel's money. When the victim refused, Patel allegedly raped her once when she was alone in the shop and told her that he had filmed her act on the camera and would malign her if she refused to keep relations with him," said an official from the police station. 

Later, Patel's driver Subhash had also molested her. Following the complaint, the Mahila police station booked Patel, Meena and Subhash under IPC sections 376, 354-A and 114.
