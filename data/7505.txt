Description:
			A 24-year-old electronics engineer, who could not accept the rejection of his marriage proposal, first attacked the woman, a relative, with a sharp weapon and then tried to commit suicide by jumping off the second floor of a building in Shahu Colony in Karvenagar on Sunday morning.

The woman, who sustained injuries on her shoulder, is undergoing treatment in a private hospital. The suspect, Sanjay Shivaji Mane, of Malshiras in Solapur district was badly injured after jumping off the building. "Mane's jaw, legs and ribs were fractured and he is being treated in a private hospital. His condition is stable," said P L Nalawade, assistant inspector of the Warje Malwadi police station.

Nalawade told TOI that Mane was looking for a job. The woman, who is Mane's sister-in-law's sister, hails from Satara district. She is pursuing a computer science course from a city-based institution. "She lives in a hostel in Shahu Colony in Karvenagar," he said.

On Sunday around 9am, Mane arrived at Shahu Colony from Malshiras to meet her. "Mane was pursuing the woman to marry him, but she was not keen. Angered by her refusal, Mane threatened to kill her," Nalawade said.

As they were talking, all of a sudden he assaulted her with a sharp weapon and the woman sustained injuries on her hands and shoulder. "She ran from the spot to save herself," he added.

Mane then ran to the second floor of the hostel and jumped. " We will arrest Mane after he is discharged from the hospital," he added.
