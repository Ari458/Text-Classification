Abduction, Human Trafficking, Rape
Description:
			A 24-year-old boy from Nagpur managed to rescue his sister from the clutches of women traffickers after seven days and night of relentless investigative work, even as the cops were content with simply registering a missing complaint.

The 18-year-old girl, Meenakshi (name changed), had left home after a fight, and gone to a friend's mother, who took her to Rajkot for a 'vacation'. However, the woman handed over Meenakshi to a distant relative, who raped her and planned to sell her off.
