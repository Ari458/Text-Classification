Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			The victim was lured by her 28-year-old boyfriend into going out on a motorcycle ride with him. He then took her to his friend's place where two others - a minor and a 22-year-old - were waiting for them. She was confined in the house and raped by all three of them.

She somehow managed to escape and was spotted by passersby near the Ghazipur Murga Mandi; they alerted the cops, who came and took her home.
