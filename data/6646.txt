Murder
Description:
			The disrobed body of a 75-year-old woman ashram inmate was found today in Katwa area, 60 km from here but the post mortem did not indicate any rape or death due to rape.

Burdwan Superintendent of Police Kunal Agarwal said the septuagenarian widow's body was found at a little distance from the ashram this morning at Agradeep and four persons have been detained in connection with the incident.

The woman was an inmate of Charandas ashram, which is holding the annual Gopinath Mela since March 16. Last evening a programme of devotional songs had been organised there.

Following the sighting of the body this morning, angry locals attacked the ashram alleging that the woman had been raped and murdered and beat up some of the people present there.

The presence of a pair of trousers, a lighter and a pair of men's chappals led them to believe that the woman had been brutalised.

However, the post mortem report which came later during the day did not indicate any rape or death due to it.

District Magistrate Soumitra Mohan said the reasons for the elderly woman's death is being investigated by the police.
