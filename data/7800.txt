Rape
Description:
			A 36-year-old man was arrested for the allegedly raping a woman over a period of time and blackmailing her with a video clip, in Central Delhi's Chandni Mahal area, police said today. 

The accused, identified as Mohammed Naved, had befriended the woman in February at a mobile repair shop in the locality and they exchanged their phone numbers. 

Soon, he asked the woman out for dinner at a restaurant in Chandni Mahal on her birthday and convinced her into going to a lodge next to the restaurant, on the pretext of a surprise, where he allegedly raped her and claimed to have shot a video of the incident, said a police officer. 

Naved allegedly raped the woman several times over a period of time threatening her of uploading the video clip over internet. He also allegedly started to extort money from her and got a SIM card issued in her name, said the official. 

When Naved allegedly started asking the woman to go around with his friends, she approached the police and reported the matter, said the officer. 

A case was registered under Sections 376 (rape), 384 (extortion) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of IPC and Naved was arrested, the officer said. 

However, the police haven't yet recovered any obscene video clip which the accused claimed to have possessed. Further investigation is underway, the officer added.
