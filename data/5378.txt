Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			About 20 days after the suspected rape and murder of a Plus II girl student in Umari-Dharma-Saranapur of Ganjam district, a similar incident was reported in the district on Friday when another teenage girl was found murdered after suspected rape.

Police recovered the body of the 17-year-old from Balisahi, on the outskirts of Bhanjanagar, about 80 km from here. The girl's legs were tied with her dress and head covered with hay. Two heavy stones had been placed on the body, police said.

"Circumstantial evidence suggests the girl was raped before being murdered. But this can only be confirmed after getting the post-mortem report," said a senior police officer.

"Police are investigating the crime from different angles," added sub-divisional police officer Bhanjanagar R C Sethi.

The girl, a school dropout and daughter of a daily labourer, had gone to a paddy field, about 5 km from her house at Balisahi on Thursday afternoon along with her father. She left the paddy fields for home around 3pm. When she did not return home till late, her family members informed the police and conducted a search for her. They located the body of the girl near the village late at night and informed the police.
