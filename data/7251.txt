Murder
Description:
			A 40-year-old man, who hurled acid at his wife, leading to her death, was sentenced to life in prison by the III Additional District and Sessions Court Judge in Coimbatore, B Karthikeyan, on Wednesday.

V Thambi alias Ravichandran (40) from Perur Chettipalayam, used to run a company which separated gold traces from sand. He had married T Chandralekha (30) in 2007. Both had divorced or separated from their previous partners.

A few years ago, Thambi had suffered a paralytic attack following which he had begun to suspect his wife's fidelity.

On November 6, 2014, Chandralekha was talking to an astrologer, Arumugam, at Vysial Street when Thambi saw them. He then purchased a bottle of acid and hurled it at his wife and Arumugam who also suffered burn injuries in the attack.

Chandralekha was admitted to CMCH where she gave a declaration stating that her husband had attacked her. She died a day later. Police registered a case of attempted murder which was later altered to a case of murder and arrested Thambi.

On Wednesday, judge B Karthikeyan sentenced Thambi to life in prison and imposed a fine of Rs 5,000. If he does not pay the fine, he would have to serve an additional six months in jail.

Thambi has been lodged at Coimbatore Central Prison.
