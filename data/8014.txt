Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			Just a week after a four-year-old girl was raped and dumped near a railway track in north Delhi's Keshavpuram, two minor girls were abducted and raped in west and east Delhi on Friday night. 

The spate of sexual crimes against children has led to outrage across the city and a political blame game over the functioning of Delhi Police. 

A two-and-a-half-year-old girl was abducted in west Delhi's Nihal Vihar during a power cut at a Ramlila venue. She was found unconscious by neighbours near a transformer in a park in the early hours of Saturday. 

Her family has alleged that the cops at the Ramlila didn't help her grandmother look for her. Two men were seen taking away a child, probably the girl, in CCTV footage of a shop. 

In the other incident at a slum in Anand Vihar in east Delhi, a five-year-old girl was picked up by a drunk neighbour and digitally raped.
