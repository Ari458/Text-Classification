Abduction, Rape
Description:
			A 32-year-old woman employed with a Gurgaon-based private firm has alleged she was kidnapped and gang-raped by three men, one of them a lawyer, at a farmhouse on Friday night and later dumped nude on Sohna Road.

Police lodged a case of kidnapping and rape and arrested two of the three men, except the lawyer, on Saturday. A preliminary investigation revealed the woman knew at least one of her three attackers, a 38-year-old man identified as Tejpal.

"There was contact on phone between Tejpal and the lady in the evening. So it's not an incident of unknown people abducting a woman and raping her. How and where they met and what transpired is being investigated into," said Vivek Sharma, joint commissioner of police (crime), Gurgaon.

The woman was rescued from Sohna Road by the police after a passerby spotted her and called for help. In her complaint, she alleged she was returning home from work and had stopped at a medical store. The three, who were in a car, allegedly stopped beside her as she walked out of the store, pulled her into the vehicle and drove towards Bhondsi.

She told the police she was taken to a farmhouse where the men raped her and threatened to kill her.

Her statement was recorded. A medical examination confirmed rape.

Bhondsi police station head Pradeep Kumar said a case had been registered against the trio Tejpal, Bag Singh (50) and the lawyer, Asha Ram. Singh was the other person arrested.
