Description:
			A man allegedly killed his eight-month-old daughter by throwing her into a well because he wanted a male child.
    
 The incident took place at Gandipet village in the outskirts of the city.
     
/8E Ramulu, a labourer, made his wife drink toddy with him. After she slept, he picked up the baby girl and threw her into a well in the nearby field and then returned to his bed.
     In the morning, Ramulu played innocent and asked his wife about the baby and started a search. But the villagers suspected that something was fishy, and questioned him.
     Finally he confessed to the act. He also showed the well to villagers before fleeing from the spot. The girl's body was later retrieved from the well.
     The couple already had a 3-year-old girl and he badly wanted a son when his wife delivered for the second time.
