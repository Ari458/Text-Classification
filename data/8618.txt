Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			The Thudiyalur All Women Police have arrested a 17-year-old boy of Chinnamathampalayam, near Mettupalayam, on charges of sexually assaulting a 4-year-old child. The Police said that the incident happened around 9.30 p.m. Monday at the house of the accused.

The child’s father, a factory worker, had told the police in his complaint that on Monday afternoon he had instructed his daughter’s balwadi teacher to drop her at a neighbour’s house. The girl was there from 3 p.m. to 10 p.m., till he reached home.

He had instructed the teacher to do so because his wife had just given birth to their second child at the Mettupalayam Government Hospital.

On reaching home, he noticed that his daughter had sustained injuries in her private parts and on inquiry learnt from his daughter that the neighbour’s 17-year-old son had sexually assaulted her. He then admitted her to the Mettupalayam Government Hospital and lodged a complaint with the police.

The police said that they produced him before the Juvenile Justice Board officer concerned and have been sent him to the reformation school.
