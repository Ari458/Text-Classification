Child Sexual Abuse, Murder, Rape
Description:
			An eleven-year-old girl was allegedly raped and crushed to death with stones on New Year's eve at Basadera, 45 kms from Jamshedpur, and the complaint on it was lodged with the police only today.

Police said the complaint was lodged by the girl's father and villagers against unidentified person for the rape and murder of the standard V student six days ago. The victim had gone to pluck flowers from a nearby jungle on New Year's eve when she met the ghastly fate, sub-divisional police officer of Ghatsila Sanjeev Besra said.

Her family members and villagers searched for her when she did not return and found her body in the jungle the next day, he said. They, however, did not inform police then and cremated the girl, Besra said.

The girl's father along with the villagers went to the police station today and narrated the incident. The FIR was registered based on the statement of the girl's father.

No arrest has yet been made and police suspect involvement of person of the same village, Besra said, adding investigation in the case is on.
