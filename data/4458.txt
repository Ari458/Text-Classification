Description:
			Police today filed a case against a person for allegedly inflicting injuries on his 30-year-old wife's body parts with knife and blade.

The woman, identified as Brijesh, a native of Aligarh, has around 150 injury marks, inflicted by blade and knife, on her legs, hands and stomach.

Brijesh, a mother of two children, alleged that she was married to Sanjay eight years back and presently lives in Vasundhara in Indirapuram area. Since she tied the knot with him, he started harassing her, Brijesh said in her complaint.

"He used to inflict injury marks with blade and knife in a fit of rage whenever a scuffle broke out between them. He had been harassing me mentally and physically for several years," Brijesh said.

She also alleged that her husband doesn't like his children. Brijesh yesterday approached Deputy Superintendent of Police Ran Vijay Singh, who ordered station officer of Indirapuram police to register a case against Sanjay.

Woman alleged that she had approached Indirapuram police three times earlier, but her efforts went in vain.

"We have registered a case under various Sections of the IPC. Police have launched a manhunt to nab him, who would be arrested soon. Police have sent the woman to hospital for medical treatment," the police officer said.
