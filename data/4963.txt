Murder, Rape
Description:
			A 46-year-old woman was allegedly gang-raped and murdered by unknown assailants at Virat Nagar village during wee hours on Thursday. Though all the cash and other valuables were intact, police have not ruled out the possibility of robbery in this connection.

According to the police, the woman identified as Susheela is a widow and lived alone in her house. "Her only son works in Mumbai while her three daughters are married. It appears that some organized gang such as Bawaria or Pardi gang could be behind this heinous act. The assailants barged into the house after breaking the main door of the house," said Jeetram Bishnoi, circle officer, Shahpura.

The matter came to light in the morning when some people in the neighborhood visited the house and saw the woman's body on the bed. The villagers then informed the police. "The woman's body was found tied in a blood-stained bedsheet," said a senior police officer.

Forensic experts and dog squad rushed to the spot. "She was a poor woman who worked as labourer and as a maid in various houses in the locality. All the things in her house are intact," said a senior police officer.

On the question of rape, a senior police officer said, "It could either be rape or consensual sex as all the clothes of the woman were lying at a distance in the house. There are also clues that the murder could be the outcome of some old dispute or rivalry."

Senior police officers investigating the case said that presently it is a blind murder as no concrete clue in this case has been found.

"We are working on different angles to crack the mystery. The body has been sent for post mortem and the deceased's son has also been intimated," said an officer.
