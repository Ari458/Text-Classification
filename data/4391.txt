Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A three-year-old girl was raped in an open space between two sets of railway tracks at Kandivali by an unidentified man. While the incident occurred on March 9, her family took time to realize that something was amiss and registered a complaint only on Wednesday. 

The girl's family hails from Nashik and sells rudraksha necklaces for a living. They stay in a 20 feet passage between a set of tracks leading to the yard and another set of tracks operated for locals. 

On March 9, the girl's parents were asleep when they heard her weeping around 2 am. They woke up with a start and found her bleeding. But they suspected that a rat had bitten their child as they slept in the open everyday. Later in the day, the girl's parents took her to the Shatabdi Hospital at Kandivali, where she was administered injections and given antibiotics for rat bites.
