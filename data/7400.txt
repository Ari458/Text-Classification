Description:
			The state children's court recently acquitted Swadesh alias Tinku Bharati, who was charged with allegedly kidnapping and raping a 14-year-old girl in 2012.

Vandana Tendulkar, president of the children's court in Panaji, exonerated the accused under Sections 363 (kidnapping) and 376 (rape) of the IPC read with Sec 8(2) (grave sexual assault) of the Goa Children's Act, 2003.

The prosecution alleged that on April 21, 2012, the accused, a native of Uttar Pradesh and resident of Sao Jose de Areal in Salcete, had forcibly taken the survivor from the lawful guardianship of her parents and had committed the offence.

The prosecution had examined eight witnesses which included the survivor's father, who was also the complainant in the case.

The court observed that the father of the survivor had not personally seen her leaving the house.

It further noted that "it is only the neighbour of the victim (survivor) who had seen her near the scene of the offence. But which neighbour has not been examined by the prosecution".

The court also noted that the identity of the accused was not confirmed either in view of the testimony of the survivor's father or of the contents of the complaint he had filed before the police.

The clothes of the survivor and of the accused, which were sent for examination to the Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL) at Hyderabad did not establish any evidence against the accused.

Dr Sunil Chimbolkar, who had medically examined the survivor on April 24, had stated before the court that there was evidence of sexual intercourse seven to ten days prior to the examination.
