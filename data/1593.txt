Rape
Description:
			Four years after a mentally retarded girl was gangraped at Nari Niketan, Sector 26, Chandigarh, a local Court today awarded 10 years' imprisonment to all the nine accused in the case.

On May 18, 2009, Police initially registered a case of rape after the girl, a minor at that time, was found pregnant. Following this, it was later discovered that the girl had been raped by several inmates and public servants and that the crime was abetted and assisted by women inmates of Nari Niketan. The Police had later registered a case of gangrape under Section 376(2)(g) of the Indian Penal Code, which was later converted to Section 376(2)(c) of IPC (rape of an inmate in a government-run Institution).
