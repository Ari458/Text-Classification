Molestation
Description:
			Former CPI(M) MLA Manoranjan Acharjee was arrested in a molestation case today, a day after Tripura Assembly witnessed uproarious scenes over the Opposition's demand for his arrest.

Acharjee was asked to come to Amarpur police station in Gomati district and was arrested following questioning, Superintendent of Police (Police Control) Uttam Bhowmick said.
An FIR, lodged last month, accused Acharjee of molesting an eight-year-old girl inside a party office at Amarpur.

"In view of an allegation of moral degradation of the MLA of Birganj constituency, Manoranjan Acharjee, the party's state committee conducted an inquiry into the allegation and asked him to resign from the post of MLA. He also submitted the resignation from the post of MLA to the state Assembly," a party statement had said on December 10.
