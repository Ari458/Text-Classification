Dowry Harassment
Description:
			The accused Umadevi, a professor in AU's department of botany, and her husband Ram Gopal, deputy director in agriculture economics were arrested. Their son Sasi Mallik works as an animation designer in
Hyderabad, while his parents live in MVP Colony.

On May, 2011, Sasi married Prathyusha from Vijayawada. Sasi's parents were offered `8 lakh in cash, a house site worth `13 lakh and some other household goods as dowry
by Prathyusha's parents at the time of the marriage. The couple lived together for nearly a month. Since then, the girl's in-laws as well as her husband reportedly started harassing her for more dowry and another house site at Vijayawada.

The girl was sent to her parents' house, the police added. A few days back, the girl reached Visakhapatnam and appealed to her in-laws to allow her into their house, but they rejected her request, the police said.
