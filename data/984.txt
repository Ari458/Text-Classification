Crime, Dowry Harassment
Description:
			Victim Indu Devi was married to Devendra Singh on February 28, 2000. After marriage, Indu’s in-laws started to torture her for dowry and on July 14, 2001, she was burnt alive by her in-laws. The death was reported in the Patwari Chowki, but the revenue police initially did not lodge a report. After much protesting, the FIR was finally lodged. It took 10 years for this judgement to come out. Why so much time when the facts of the case were fairly obvious? Justice delayed is Justice denied.
