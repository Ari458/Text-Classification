Description:
			A 15-year-old gang-rape survivor from a village in Kurukshetra committed self-immolation on Thursday night following physical intimidation and threats by the kin of the two men convicted in the case and the other accused. She succumbed to 90% burns at a Chandigarh hospital on Friday afternoon.

A case of abetment to suicide was registered against eight people -- Paramwati, Rajesh, Harjinder Kaur, Delli, Kanta, Puchu, Kesar and Ram Kumar -- on the complaint of the girl's grandfather.

The girl was gang-raped in February 2015 and Parveen Kumar, Mangat Ram, Ram Kumar and Rajesh Kumar were named as accused. However, a fast-track court handed out a verdict convicting two of the four accused -- Mangat and Parveen -- in May.

The girl's family alleged that they were facing constant threats after the gang-rape case was registered, and things worsened once the court convicted the accused. The rape survivor's family members alleged that all of them had been assaulted and threatened this week.

Initially, a case under sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt),452 ( house-trespass after preparation for hurt, assault or wrongful restraint)and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC was registered, but cops added Section 306 (abetment of suicide) of the IPC on Friday following the rape survivor's death.

Her body was sent for autopsy. SHO of the concerned police station Ajay Disodia said teams had been constituted to nab the accused.

According to sources, the rape survivor and her family were planning to retire for the day when she doused herself in kerosene and set herself afire.

The teenager was nearly unconscious when her family took her to a Kurukshetra hospital, from where she was referred to Chandigarh.
