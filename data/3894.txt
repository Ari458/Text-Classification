Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A Delhi court has sentenced two men, including a senior citizen, to 10 years rigorous imprisonment for gang raping a 16-year-old-girl in 2003.

The court sent 65-year-old Ran Singh and Sri Bhagwan, 44, to jail after holding them guilty of gang rape and criminal intimidation and also imposed a fine of Rs 30,000 on each of them.

According to police, a case was registered in December 2003 on the basis of the girl's complaint in which she alleged that she was gang raped by Singh and Bhagwan, who had taken her to a farm house on the pretext of providing her a job.

She had said in her complaint that Singh was known to her mother, who was working as a guard, and he had assured her that he would get the girl employed.

On December 6, 2003, Singh came to her house with Bhagwan and told her that she will have to go to meet a person for the job and on the next day, they came in a car and took her to a farm house.

At the farm house, both Singh and Bhagwan raped her and threatened her that she would be killed if she disclosed the incident to anyone, they later on dropped her home.

When her mother asked her about the job, she narrated the entire incident after which her mother informed the police and a case was registered. 

During the trial, both Singh and Bhagwan denied all the allegations levelled against them and claimed that they have been falsely implicated.

Their counsel argued that the testimony of the girl was full of material contradictions and she had lodged the complaint to implicate the two men.

The court, however, convicted Singh and Bhagwan observing that the testimony of the victim was clear and "trustworthy".
