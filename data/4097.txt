Abduction, Child Sexual Abuse, Murder
Description:
			A 13-year-old girl was thrown into a well after she was raped and strangled in Rajasthan's Sikar district. 

Her body was found tied to a large stone to ensure that the body stayed submerged. The police have rounded up four men in the case. 

The girl was a resident of a hamlet in Sikar's Patan area. She was a Class IX student. She had gone to school which is nearly four km from her house. She missed the bus and was last seen walking home. 

When she didn't return her family members launched a search. They found a bag near a well which was on way to school. Suspecting that she fell into it, the water was pumped out. 

The body was found with her stole wrapped around her neck. It seems she was strangled to death. A heavy stone was tied to her body before she was thrown into the well. 

The girl's body was taken to hospital where postmortem was conducted. Prima facie it seems that she was raped. But police are waiting for the post-mortem report. They have rounded up some people on suspicion. Interrogation with them is going on.
