Murder
Description:
			A 35-year-old man, who allegedly murdered his wife, but cooked up a fake story that she was gangraped and killed by robbers, was today arrested by police.

The accused has been identified as Bharat Ramdas Dhokrat, a resident of Malegaon in Sinnar taluka of Nashik district.

According to Praveen Padwal, District Superintendent of Police (Rural), Bharat had murdered his 27-year-old wife Sheetal following a dispute with her last night.

"After the murder, he told a false story to police that while they were returning home in Kolgaon village in Sinnar taluka on motorcycle they were stopped by four robbers at Bharvas Phata, near Lasalgaon town," Padwal said.

"The robbers then tied him to a tree and gangraped his wife. They also looted the woman's gold ornaments and his cash, altogether valued at around Rs 17,000, before fleeing," he added.

However, suspecting Bharat's version of the story, police thoroughly interrogated him, following which he confessed to his crime.

He also told them that he had taken assistance of his friend identified as Gulab Thakar in executing the crime, Padwal added.
