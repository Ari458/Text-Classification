Description:
			13-year-old girl from Santhal in West Bengal was forcefully brought to Delhi and employed as a domestic help in Janakpuri, at the house of Nirja Bhaskar. The girl's family had urged Nirja to let the girl return home but Nirja refused to comply. Instead, she demanded that the family cough up a sum of Rs 16,000 which she had paid to the placement agency. 

The girl was brought to the capital by Pina Roy and Rina Hemram - both in the police net - three months back. After reaching Delhi she stayed in Sangam Vihar with Rina where she was often beaten up by Rina's husband. She made umpteen requests to go back home but the couple employed her as a domestic help. Later, she worked somewhere else. After suffering untold misery at the hands of her new employer, she ran away to Sangam Vihar. There she came in contact with another person from Bengal who used her as a bonded labourer and was planning to sell her as a child bride.
