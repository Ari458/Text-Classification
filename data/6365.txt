Rape
Description:
			A 37-year-old woman, who was allegedly raped by a government officer, has threatened to protest against the accused seeking his arrest in the matter, police said today.

The woman has alleged that the police was shielding the accused Lal Singh, who had raped her in November last year.

The victim lodged a rape case in the same month.

She also alleged that the accused, joint director in the department of animal husbandry, threatened her several times pressurising her to withdraw the case.

"When they continued to threaten me and my family, my 17-year old daughter committed suicide in a state of mental shock in December. Despite all this tragedy, police did not arrest the rape accused," she said.

President of Rastriya Meena Mahasabha, BL Meena, said the victim and community people will launch an agitation if the accused is not arrested.

Refuting the allegations, Singh said: "The allegation is baseless and the woman is trying to create pressure on me in connection with a property dispute." 

Police said the matter was lodged with Sez police station and the investigation is underway.
