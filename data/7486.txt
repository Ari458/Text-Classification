Child Sexual Abuse
Description:
			The children's court convicted Devilal Kurmi, a resident of Bambolim, for committing a 'grave sexual assault' on a minor girl and a minor boy.

It was the case of the prosecution that prior to November 9, 2010, the accused, a native of Assam, committed the offence near the Bambolim beach. Public prosecutor K Sanzgiry examined 11 witnesses, including Dr Madhu Ghodkirekar who had conducted the medical examination of the victims.

The accused had claimed the benefit of doubt as there was no medical evidence on record to support the prosecution's case. But the court held the accused guilty and observed that 'there is no reason to disbelieve the testimonies of the minor victims in this case'.
