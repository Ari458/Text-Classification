Domestic Violence, Dowry Harassment
Description:
			The Superintendent of Police of Kolar Gold Fields (KGF) police district, H.R. Bhagavandas, has suspended two constables following charges of dowry harassment to the wife of one of the cop as well as charges of dereliction of duty.

Mahendrakumar, a constable attached to Andersonpet police station and his brother Sunilkumar, constable with Oorgaum police station, are the cops kept under suspension.

They allegedly harassed Ramya, wife of Mahendrakumar, to bring more dowry from her parents and threw her out of the house along with the children.

Ramya, a native of Yaraganahalli, filed a complaint with Marikuppam police in connection with this. Both of them were accused of torturing Ramya mentally and physically.

Following this, the police registered a criminal case against the accused cops and a special report was submitted to the SP, a release said.

The action was initiated as the brothers, who are supposed to maintain discipline in the Police department, engaged in dereliction of duty beside the charges of dowry harassment, the release added.
