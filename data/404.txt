Description:
			A 38 yr old woman poisoned her five minor children aged 9-13 years and then took her own life in Uttar Pradesh's Banda district, police said Friday. She was evidently depressed over declining relations with her policeman husband.

"In a suicide note, the woman has alleged her husband was a drunkard and used to assault her and their three daughters and two sons," police inspector Ghanshyam Pandey told reporters in Banda, some 250 km from Lucknow.
