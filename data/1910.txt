Rape
Description:
			A 32-year-old man was arrested today for allegedly repeatedly sexually abusing a seven-year-girl from his neighbourhood in suburban Mumbai, police said.

Shashikant Ojha, employed at a restaurant, was apprehended from his hut in the suburban Sahar area for repeatedly raping the class II student on the pretext of offering her chocolates and showing rabbits, they said.

According to police, Ojha had sexually assaulted the minor at least 3-4 times, latest on January 4, while picking her up on her way to tuitions.

He would threaten the girl with dire consequences if she revealed about it to anyone.

"The girl was under stress and was too scared to reveal the matter to anyone. She would often mumble in her sleep," said a police officer.

The incident came to the light today after her parents took her into confidence after noticing change in her behaviour and lodged a complaint with Sahar police.
