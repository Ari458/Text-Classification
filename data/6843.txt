Molestation
Description:
			Days after the Moga bus molestation case, another woman was allegedly molested on board a bus in Punjab. 

The driver and conductor of a private bus were arrested after a woman alleged that she had been molested by a passenger near Punjab's Khanna town, police said on Monday. 

The incident took place near Khanna town, 60 km from here, on Sunday when the woman boarded the bus from Sirhind town to Sahnewal near Ludhiana. 

In her complaint to the police, the woman alleged that a fellow passenger sat next to her and started touching her. When she protested, he moved to a seat behind her but continued to pass lewd comments. 

The victim said she complained to the bus conductor and driver but they did not listen to her. She then called up her husband who informed the police. 

The police set up 'nakas' (check-point) along the route but the bus driver did not stop despite being signalled to stop. 

The police chased and stopped the bus. Driver Jagwinder Singh and conductor Kulwinder Singh have been arrested, Khanna district police chief G.S. Gill said. 

However, the passenger is yet to be arrested. 

The incident took place just four days after a 13-year-old girl was molested and thrown out of a moving bus belonging to Punjab deputy chief minister Sukhbir Singh Badal's company, resulting in her death.
