Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			Enraged family members of a seven-year-old girl roughed up her elder brother's friend for allegedly sexually exploiting her. Prashant Chanotkar, 27, a small-time dry cleaner, would regularly take the girl out on his bicycle to offer her chocolates.

Chanotkar and the girl's brother had earlier worked together. Chanotkar frequently visited the Zingabai Takli residence of Sushma (name changed).

On the day of the crime, Sushma had just returned from her tuition class when Chanotkar asked her for an outing. Though her mother objected, Sushma left with Chanotkar and returned after more than an hour. By then, Sushma's family members had already started searching for the girl. When Chanotkar retuned with the girl, the family members, along with some neighbours, first thrashed him and dragged him to Gittikhadan police station.

It is learnt, cops also summoned members from an NGO and officials from Women and Child Department to record Sushma's statement. The girl initially denied but later divulged that Chanotkar had made sexual advances before attempting to sodomize her.

A senior officer said though medical examination of the girl did not suggest rape, offence has been registered as per the amended section which has come into effect after the Delhi bus gang rape incident. Chanotkar was later arrested.
