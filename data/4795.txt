Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A man, who was convicted for raping his 14-year-old neighbour after tying her with a cloth, has been sentenced to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment by a Delhi court. 

Additional Sessions Judge M C Gupta held 35-year-old Amit Kumar guilty of raping and criminally intimidating the minor girl, while relying on the testimony of the victim and her parents. 

"I am of the considered opinion that as far as the involvement of Amit Kumar in the commission of the offences under sections 376/506 (rape and criminal intimidation) of the IPC is concerned, the same is sufficiently established by the cogent and reliable evidence," the judge said. 

The court also imposed a fine of Rs 30,000 on Kumar, a resident of Rohini. 

"The testimonies are found to be natural, clear, reliable, inspiring confidence and having a ring of truth... there is nothing in their statements to suggest that they had any animus against the accused to falsely implicate him in the case," the court said. 

According to the prosecution, on August 2, 2011, when the girl was alone at her residence in the afternoon, her neighbour Kumar entered her house and raped her. 

The girl had told the police that Kumar forcefully entered her house in a drunken state and slapped and raped her after tying her up with a cloth. He had also blind-folded her. 

She had alleged that that Kumar also called three more persons, who took turns to rape her, but they could not be arrested as she failed to identify them. 

The girl's father was admitted to a hospital at that time and her mother was with him when the offence took place. 

The girl had told police that she told Kumar's wife about the incident but she refused to believe her and instead beat her up.
