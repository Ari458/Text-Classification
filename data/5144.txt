Child Sexual Abuse, Murder, Rape
Description:
			The Thane district court today sentenced a man to double life imprisonment for rape and murder of a 12 years old girl.

Additional Sessions Judge V V Virkar said the accused Bharatsingh Babusingh Rathod deserved no leniency.

Public Prosecutor Ashok Khamkar said that on the afternoon of March 2, 2012, the girl left her house in neighbouring Diva town for tuition. Her body was found on a patch of land behind the building at night.

Police probe revealed that Rathod, who lived in the same building, had persuaded her to go to his room, where he raped and murdered her. Later he put the body in a gunny sack and dumped it behind the building.

Relying on circumstantial evidence, the court convicted Rathod, and awarded him two life sentences on different counts.
