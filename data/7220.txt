Description:
			Two influential people of Gobritola under Khorabar police station limit in Gorakhpur district allegedly beat a seven-year-old girl before tying her under scorching sun as punishment for plucking eucalyptus saplings from their garden on Sunday afternoon. 

Though both of them have been booked under Section 151 of IPC, no FIR has been lodged in this connection. 

Reports said Puja (name changed), daughter of one Rangilal who is a resident of Kurmour in Gobritola under Khorabar police station limits, carelessly plucked some eucalypts saplings from the garden of Sitaram Nishad, an influential man of the village. 

Annoyed over her act, Sitaram's sons Baburam and Vinod beat her badly and later tied her with a cow latch under the sun. When Puja's mother Manju Devi came to know about this, she asked Baburam and Vinod to release her but they refused to do so and beat her. 

When Manju approached the police they booked Vinod and Baburam under 151 IPC. "I requested the police to lodge an FIR against Vinod and Baburam but they asked me for compromise for which I was not ready," said Manju. 

SSP Pradeep Kumar said, "I came to know about the issue on Monday. I've ordered Khorabar police to register FIR regarding the incident. The accused will not be spared."
