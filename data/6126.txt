Description:
			A rape accused, who was absconding for over a month, was arrested after he came to a local court to file an anticipatory bail application.

According to police, the accused P Ravindra, who was caught yesterday from the court premises, had raped a BTech student of a private college after blackmailing her.

The victim had registered a case against him at PM Palem police station on November 27. However, since then he had been on the run.

Police had got a tip-off that Ravindra would be coming to Bheemili court on Friday to file an anticipatory bail application. A team of PM Palem police, led by inspector S Appalaraju, laid a trap on the court premises.

"On noticing the police team at the court, Ravindra, who had covered his face with a dupatta, tried to escape from the spot. But the police team soon nabbed him," Appalaraju said.

The accused, who was carrying a bottle of phenyle in his pocket consumed its content in a bid to commit suicide, the inspector added.

Police immediately admitted the accused to a private hospital near Jagadamba Junction for treatment. He is now out of danger.

According to police, Ravindra is a native of Mylavaram area in Krishna district and had been arrested by Central Crime Station, Vijayawada at least two times on theft charges.

A case of assault was also registered against him under PM Palem police station in 2013.

Giving details of the rape case, the police officer said that Ravindra had clicked the photo of the BTech student and created morphed obscene pictures of her.

Thereafter, he started threatening her that he would make her obscene photos public. On the pretext of deleting the pictures, he invited her to his place near Madhurawada area and raped her there.
