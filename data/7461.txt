Child Sexual Abuse, Molestation, Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			Two four-year-old girls in west Delhi have been repeatedly molested allegedly by the driver and the helper of a van hired by the parents to take the children to school.

The suspects have been arrested based on the complaint filed by the parents of one of the girls. The other child's parents chose not to lodge a complaint as their daughter did not tell them of any similar harassment.

But a senior police officer said the interrogation of the suspects had revealed that both girls were harassed. The molestation went on for quite some time before coming to light on Tuesday,Deputy Commissioner of Police (West) Pushpendra Kumar said.

Whether the suspects had targeted more children in the past is a subject of investigation. As of now, the two suspects are not known to have been involved in any other crime, the DCP said.

The driver has been identified as Charanjeet Singh, 32, and his helper, Kulivinder, 30. The police said the duo would allegedly take turns to molest the children in the running vehicle.

The regular sexual harassment led to a change in behaviour of one of the girls. Her parents noticed that she had turned silent and subdued. They asked her about the reason and learnt of the abuse on Tuesday, said the officer.

The family approached the police with the girl. A case under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act and Section 354 (assault with an intention to outrage a women modesty) of the Indian Penal Code was registered on Tuesday night.

The police said they arrested the two suspects, who were unaware of the police complaint, that very night.
