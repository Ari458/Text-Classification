Description:
			A 15-year-old girl, whose parents had arranged her wedding, was saved from being married off after government officials reached the venue and prevented the ceremony.

On getting information about a minor girl's marriage being arranged, the officials of government-run Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS) reached the venue at Balajinagar in the city and took the girl under their protection.

If the parents again try to get the girl married, criminal proceedings would be initiated against them and the minor would be provided full protection by the ICDS.
