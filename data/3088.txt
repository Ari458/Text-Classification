Rape
Description:
			A minor claimed she was raped by a man in New Usmanpur area in east Delhi, with police suspecting that it could be a case of revenge against the alleged accused with whom the girl's mother had eloped.

The nine-year-old girl approached police and claimed that she was raped by 30-year-old Sanjay, after which police registered a case in this connection.

Although a case has been lodged, initial inquiries suggest that the girl was instigated by her father to frame charges against Sanjay with whom the girl's mother had eloped some time ago. The woman now stays with Sanjay.

According to police, the girl's father had apprehended that if Sanjay is arrested, his wife will return to him.

The police are waiting for the medical report of the girl to confirm whether she was raped or she made these allegations just to frame Sanjay.
