Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			Habibpur was on the boil on Monday over the alleged gang rape of a minor tribal girl who is still in hospital with serious injuries. Angry tribals refused to lodge a complaint and vowed to lynch the culprits. 

The 10-year-old girl had gone to a neighbouring village on Sunday to attend a wedding. She set off for home alone around 4.30pm as there was enough daylight and she didn't have to go far. She was crossing a small field where five-six youths grabbed her. 

They dragged her to a hideout and raped her for hours. The gang left her injured and fled. Meanwhile, people of her village had started looking for her. She was unconscious when they found her. She was taken to a local health centre and then to Malda Medical College. 

On Monday morning, a group of tribals poured into the hospital. They refused to go to police. Salko Baske, secretary of Adivasi Nagarik Unnayan Samity, said: "We have no faith in police. So we did not go to them. We know what punishment these criminals deserve. They will be lynched publicly." The tribal gathering shouted its support. 

Police have arrested a suspect and are looking for the others. SP Prasun Banerjee said: "We have spoken to the girl's elder sister and mother. They alleged that it was Chandan Murmu who led the gang. We raided the village and arrested him on Monday. We will get the others too."
