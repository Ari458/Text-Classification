Molestation, Street Harassment
Description:
			Six teenagers of a village were returning home at 4 am after attending a cultural programme. Four tribal youths, identified as Chelafru Mog (18), Keosi Mog (18), Thanga Mog (20) and Ula Mog (18), were following them. Four of the six girls were molested inside a nearby forest but the other two managed to escape and raised an alarm.

The villagers cordoned off the area and handed over the youth to police. But police allegedly didn't arrest them and also no case was registered. Later, police released them suggesting a compromise at the community level.
