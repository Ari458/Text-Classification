Child Sexual Abuse, Human Trafficking
Description:
			Five people from Kalyan, including the stepmother of a 17-year-old girl, have been booked for allegedly trying to sell the girl for Rs 2 lakh. The girl and her father escaped to Aurangabad and approached the Satara police on Saturday.

The Satara police registered an offence and transferred the case to the Kalyan police, as the alleged offence took place in the latter's jurisdiction. The five have been charged under sections 342 (wrongful confinement), 354 (A) sexual harassment, 442 (house trespass), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 34 (common intent) of the IPC.

The girl has complained that two of the suspects entered her home on October 20, when she was alone. They asked her to come along with them, but she refused. Telling her that her stepmother had sold her to them for Rs 2 lakh, they tied her up, forced her to view a porn video on a mobile and sexually harassed her, she said. As soon as her father learned what had happened that day, they left for Aurangabad.
