Description:
			A 16-year-old girl suffered burn injuries when a youth threw acid on her at Gogari Jamalpur in Khagaria, around 180km east of Patna, on Wednesday.

Two other girls, who were sleeping with the victim, also suffered minor burn injuries. All have been admitted to a local government hospital.

Khagaria DSP Ranjan Kumar Sinha said the incident occurred in the small hours of Wednesday when the girl, Rupam Kumari, was sleeping in her room. Accused Mohammad Kausar, 21, who was allegedly in love with Rupam, poured acid on her causing burn injuries around her neck, left arm and other parts of her body. The accused earlier worked as an assistant in the garage of the girl's uncle, the DSP revealed.

The victim told the police that Kausar had an altercation with her brother two days ago when he opposed his visit to their house. "Taking advantage of Rupam being alone in her room, Kausar threw acid on her through the window and fled the spot," an investigating officer said.

The officer said the accused was putting pressure on the girl for marriage, which she refused. The DSP said the accused was arrested from Muski Kothi village of the district. "The accused has confessed. The police will submit the chargesheet in the case at the earliest," the DSP said.
