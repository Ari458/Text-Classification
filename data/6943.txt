Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A 15-year-old girl was reportedly exploited sexually by her so-called boyfriend, following which an offence of rape was registered at Yashodhara Nagar police station on Tuesday. The police also took accused boyfriend Aziz Khan Shahdat Khan into custody following the complaint.

Sunita (name changed) was brought to Yashodhara Nagar police station by her family after the incident came to fore. The survivor's brother was the one who had spotted her speaking on a mobile phone. She had initially furnished evasive replies when asked about the phone. Her brother was baffled seeing a mobile phone in her possession which the family did not own. Later, when prodded, she revealed the name of Khan.

Cops said Khan had befriended Sunita as his friend was her neighbour. He would meet Sunita on the pretext of meeting his friend. Khan had gifted Sunita the mobile phone to be able to speak to her.

During their courtship, Khan took Sunita to an apartment in Mhada colony where he forced himself upon her last week. He threatened to kill her brother if she refused. Sunita too opted not to divulge the matter to anyone feeling apprehensive about her family's security.

Sub-inspector PD Kulthe of Yashodhara Nagar police station said Khan was immediately rounded up after the matter was reported to the police who are investigating.
