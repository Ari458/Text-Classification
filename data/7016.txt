Molestation
Description:
			A Kannada film actress, who has been identified as Rajini, hurled attempt to rape charges on a Congress activist Kumar. The actress filed a police complaint against Kumar who, however, overruled all charges against him.

The Congress activist, while defending himself, claimed that Rajini was blackmailing and harassing him mentally for sometime. It was reported that Kumar had invested money in one Kannada movie and he reportedly had promised Rajini to give her the lead role in the movie.

He called the actress to a house and allegedly attempted to rape Rajini. However, other people of the film unit rescued Rajini who latter approached the police filing legal complaint against Kumar. Speaking about the case against Kumar, Superintendent of Police, Ravi D Channannavar, has been quoted as saying, "The case was registered under Sections 354 and 506 at the women's police station on May 22." "The suspect, Kumar, has also submitted a complaint to me. So, we will investigate both the complaints thoroughly and conduct an impartial probe," he added.

Meanwhile, the case has taken a political turn as BJP's Yuva Morch raised demand of arresting Kumar based on the complaint filed by Rajini.
