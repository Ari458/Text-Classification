Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			Snehal Bansod, 20, has been charged with rape after he allegedly forced himself upon his 17-year-old neighbour at Hudco Colony on Monday. It's learnt that Snehal jumped over a six-foot periphery wall and sneaked into the room where the rape survivor, a standard X student, was fast asleep.

Police said that Snehal had been trying to befriend Namita (name changed) for around a year. She had been avoiding Snehal but had to respond at times as he stayed in the neighbourhood. It was reliably learnt that Snehal had also been trying to meet her.

On the day of the incident, Namita was sleeping alone in her room when she was targeted. Namita's father had gone to Bangalore while her mother was sleeping after taking medication for high blood pressure. Snehal, equipped with a contraceptive, is learnt to have compelled Namita to allow physical relations. Apart from using physical force, Snehal also issued threats to harm her family.

While she was being exploited, Namita's younger brother in a nearby room was unaware of the incident. Snehal finally fled the scene after Namita raised an alarm.

An offence was registered at Jaripatka police station after Namita approached the cops in the wee hours of the day. The cops, after registering the offence, have launched a manhunt for Snehal.
