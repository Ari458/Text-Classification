Dowry Harassment
Description:
			In an incident at Byondha village under Shergarh police station limits, a man fled when he realized that the family of the woman he intended to marry would not pay Rs. 1 lakh as dowry. 

Two years ago, Ram Singh Gujjar had arranged for his daughter to be married to Karan Singh. A week before the marriage, the groom's sister, Rambeti, called the bride's family and demanded a dowry of Rs 1 lakh. She said the marriage would not take place if the dowry was not paid. 

Unable to make arrangements for the money, the bride's family called the panchayat and sought a resolution to the problem. However, the groom, Karan Singh, did not turn up in the panchayat meeting which took place on the day of wedding. 

His father, Ratan Singh, told the panchayat members that he had fled, as he had no intention of marrying for no dowry. 

Gujjar lodged an FIR in the case against Karan, Ratan, Rambeti and two other members of the family.
