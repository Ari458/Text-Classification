Rape
Description:
			A 20-year-old woman construction labourer was allegedly raped by a middle-aged man at a village in Thane district.

While the victim was waiting at a bus stop in Dombivili to return home last night, the accused, Santosh Bane, and his friend who were passing by offered her a lift on his motorcycle, Dombivili's Manpada police station inspector K D Pardeshi said.

As the woman knew Bane, who hailed from Adavali village of Thane's Ambernath taluka, she took the lift.

After reaching a spot near the village, Bane's friend went home.

Later, the accused took the woman to an isolated place in the village and raped her at around 10 PM, according to the woman's complaint.

When she resisted his move, the accused threatened her with dire consequences, the complaint further said.

The woman has been sent for medical examination, they said, adding that further investigation was on.
