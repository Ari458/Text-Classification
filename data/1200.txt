Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			On March 21, 2011: The girl had informed the police that her father 43-year-old Tek Bahadur has been committing rape on her repeatedly for about two to three years. She said her father raped her under the influence of liquor and alleged he "assaulted and threatened" her not to reveal the incident to anyone.

"It is evident that convict treated prosecutrix only as an object to fulfill his sexual desires. The offence committed by convict is too heinous and, therefore, he does not deserve any leniency," the judge said.
