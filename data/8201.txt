			Two men have been arrested for raping a woman at a canteen in the Infosys campus in Pune, police said on Tuesday.

The accused Paritosh Baug (21) and Prakash Kisan Mahadik (30), both working at a canteen in the company campus at Rajiv Gandhi Information Technology park in Hinjewadi, allegedly raped the woman on Sunday evening.
Police said the accused, who were employed as house-keeping staff at the canteen, raped the 25-year-old woman inside the washroom.

The accused also allegedly shot the video of the rape survivor and threatened her with dire consequences if she approached the police.
But despite their threats, she lodged a complaint at the Hinjewadi police station the next day following which police arrested the two men.

Meanwhile, in a statement, Infosys said the incident involved the contractual staff of one of its partners.

We are investigating the matter and are working closely with the police to aid their investigation, the statement said.

The company also said it has a zero tolerance policy against sexual harassment which extends to contractual staff as well, and that all the campuses have stringent security measures in place.
