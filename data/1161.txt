Description:
			The victim, a 45-year-old Malad resident had to make at least 50 trips to the police station and register 14 non- cognizable complaints against her harasser before the cops finally arrested him yesterday.

The accused Nandlal Kunwarjiwala and complainant were neighbours in a chawl at Orlem Tank Road in Malad (West). According to Gupta, the culprit would make obscene gestures and pass lewd remarks at her daughters and her. "He would often stand naked at the window, facing us. When I approached the police, they registered an NC. They would say that they were under pressure from a local politician," victim said.
