Molestation, Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			LUCKNOW: Waking up from slumber, the state government suspended two IPS officials on Monday. Former deputy inspector general of Meerut police training school Devi Prasad Srivastava and 2010 batch officer Sanjeev Tyagi were the ones taken to task.

While findings of the inquiry carried out against Tyagi were yet to be made public, FIR against Srivastava had been lodged last week. A female sub-inspector who worked at the training school alleged that Srivastava grabbed her hand and made inappropriate comments. Srivastava was a provincial police services official and got promoted to the rank of superintendent in 2000.

Similarly, early in May, Tyagi was accused of sexually harassing a female IPS officer. Tyagi was posted as assistant superintendent of Kanpur police at that time and was attached to DGP office subsequently. The female officer was summoned by Tyagi at his official residence late night when the incident took place.
