Description:
			A 62-year-old school bus driver has been arrested for allegedly raping a minor girl on several occasions in south east Delhi's Govindpuri area.

Accused Rakesh, who is employed as a school bus driver, was arrested in connection with the rape of a 13-year-old girl in Govindpuri area, said a senior police officer.

The victim was taken to AIIMS after the incident came to light where rape was confirmed in medical examination, he said.

Police said that the minor had revealed that she was sexually assaulted by the accused several times in the past but she did not tell anybody out of fear. On Tuesday he again lured her with promise of money to his house when his wife was absent, and assaulted her sexually.
This time, however, the victim narrated her ordeal to her mother and finally police was informed.

After registering a case under POCSO Act and other relevant sections of IPC, police launched raids for arrest of the accused.

He was finally arrested by the police after the victim identified him near the place where he lived, added the officer.
