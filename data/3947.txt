Murder
Description:
			A 10-year-old boy was allegedly murdered by his neighbour in Dativali Road area in Mumbra in the district following an argument with the victim's family, police said today.

The accused, before pushing the boy to death from the terrace of a five-storey building last evening, also slit his throat, police said.

The accused has been identified as Kiran Tambe (25), while the victim Rahul Chavan was his neighbour's son.

Rahul's brother had gone to Tambe's place when the latter picked up quarrels with his wife on Sunday evening, Police Inspector (Crime) of Mumbra police station S R Nagarkar told PTI.

The accused scolded the boy and asked him to leave their place at once, following which he went home crying. Thinking that Tambe had beaten his son, the boy's father started arguing with him.

Other residents of the building resolved the issue between them. They also asked Tambe to vacate the building saying that he was creating nuisance for them, police said.

Disturbed over this, a day later, Tambe went to the victim's house and forcibly took Rahul to the terrace of the building. He then slit the boy's throat and then pushed him down from top of the building killing him on the spot, police said.

After the incident, Tambe had fled to Vikhroli, from where he was arrested last night.

Further investigation into the case is on, police said.
