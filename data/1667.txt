Rape
Description:
			A police team patrolling the town area noticed four youths and a woman near Pound Road. When they approached the group, police they found that the woman, in her early 30s, was in an unstable condition. Though the youths tried to escape, police managed to arrest two of them.

Primary investigation revealed that the woman, a homemaker, was a resident of Melling tea estate under Jorebungalow police station. She had come to Darjeeling on Wednesday morning with her husband, a casual worker. The woman claimed that her husband who is an alcoholic deserted her and left for the tea estate. Since the victim had no money, she could not return to her home and hence started looking for accommodation. It was then that youths approached her and reportedly raped her on the pretext of helping her.
