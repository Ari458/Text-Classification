Rape
Description:
			A 28-year-old woman was allegedly gang-raped by three youths in Naya Gaon on the pretext of providing her a job.

Though the crime took place on July 1, the woman approached the police only on Thursday, after which a case was registered. All the three accused are absconding.

According to the police complaint, the woman had accidently dialled the number one of the accused, Sandeep Kumar, a resident of Naya Gaon, and started talking to him as she was in need of a job. The victim said that after talking to the accused for a few days, she decided to meet him as he sounded decent over the phone.

Sandeep had told her that she could get a job easily as he knew some people. He told her that he had fixed a meeting of hers with them on July 1 in Naya Gaon. During their meeting, he offered her soft a drink laced with sedative. After that, she fell unconscious and Sandeep and his friends raped her. They threatened her against revealing anything and fled from the spot. She went home from there and was medically examined in Kharar civil hospital.

Police have registered a case against the three youths under sections 328 (causing hurt by poisoning) and 376 (rape) of the IPC.

This is the second case of gang-rape in the district within this month. On July 9, an 18-year-old mentally challenged girl was gang-raped by three youths near Derabassi. No arrests have been made in that case so far.
