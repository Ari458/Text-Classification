Murder
Description:
			A 29-year-old woman was shot and strangled to death allegedly by her nephew who was reprimanded by her husband some days ago in Trilokpuri locality of East Delhi.

The incident happened when the deceased, identified as Kavita, was alone at her residence. Her children were at a relative's home while her husband was out for work.

As per eyewitnesses, her nephew Raja (21) barged into the house and started an argument with her. At point, he took out a pistol and fired a bullet at Kavita which hit her in the wrist. He then strangulated her.

Neighbours rushed to the house after hearing the gunshot and tried to nab him but he threatened them with the gun and fled from the spot.

The police received a call at 9 am after which a team reached the spot and sent the victim to Lal Bahadur Shastri Hospital where she was declared brought dead. A case of murder has been registered at Kalyanpuri police station.

Kavita lives with her husband Ravi and two children.

Her husband works as a fourth class employee with the Municipal Corporation of Delhi.

Sometime ago, Ravi had scolded and beaten up Raja after he came to know that he was keeping bad company and used to have frequent arguments with his parents. Ravi had told Raja not to visit his house again and he was probably enraged over it.

Efforts are on to apprehend Raja. Several police teams are conducting raids in different areas in his pursuit.
