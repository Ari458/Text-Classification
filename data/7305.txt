Rape
Description:
			Nedumudi police on Tuesday arrested a woman and a sopanam singer of a temple in connection with the rape of 35-year-old mentally challenged woman.

Station head Gopalakrishnan Nair said the accused were Omanakuttan, 44, and Ammini, 60, both hailing from Chembupuram. Apart from singing, Omanakuttan also lent money to women in his village. Ammini also borrowed money from Omanakuttan and had difficulties in paying back the amount.

Omanakuttan told Ammini that he did not want money and instead asked her if she could arrange the mentally-challenged woman for him for having sex.

So Ammini took the girl, the daughter of her friend, to her home under some pretext and she also called Omanakuttan.

Omanakuttan raped the girl at the residence of Ammini. Later, the woman told the incident to her mother. The police arrested the duo as per the complaint of the victim's mother.

Omanakuttan and Ammini were produced before the local court at Ramanakari and the court remanded them in judicial custody for 14 days.
