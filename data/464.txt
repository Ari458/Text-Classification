Rape
Description:
			A 20-year-old girl was gang-raped in Panki on Saturday night. The incident led to unrest among the kin and locals, who demanded immediate arrest of the four accused, two of whom were absconding.

The incident took place in Ratanpur Colony in Panki, where the girl had come to stay with her paternal uncle and his family. The Panki police informed that the girl was gang-raped when she had gone to attend nature's call in the fields.

The accused even threatened by the victim not to scream and tell anyone about the incident.

"The girl is limping and unable to walk. There were scratches all over the body indicating that the girl had put up a strong resistance," said a relative.
