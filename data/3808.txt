Murder
Description:
			A local court has convicted a 23-year-old youth for murdering a married woman, with whom he was having an affair, and sentenced him to life imprisonment.

In the verdict delivered, the Principal District and Sessions judge P C Bavaskar held the accused Pramod Sirsat guilty of murdering Pratibha Nikhade at Takli Khojbal village in Balapur taluka in 2011, under section 302 of IPC.

The court also imposed a fine of Rs 1,000 on Pramod but acquitted his parents for want of strong evidence.

It was the prosecution's case that Pratibha had deserted her husband to stay with Pramod, with whom she was having an affair, and they were staying together as live-in partners.

According to the prosecution, Pramod set Pratibha ablaze as his parents objected to their relationship.

The victim had named Pramod and his parents in her dying declaration.
