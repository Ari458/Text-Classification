Description:
			An 18-year-old woman was burnt alive when some people allegedly flung her into a blazing house at Bijroula village in Bihar's Vaishali district on Sunday, police said. The charred remains of Gunjan (18) was recovered by police from the gutted house hours after she was allegedly thrown into it by some villagers following a dispute with the girl's father Harinder Singh.

Harinder, locked in a property dispute with his brother Suresh Singh in the village, earlier thrashed one Harisudan for helping Suresh look after the property, police said. Soon, a section of villagers picked up a fight with Harinder and his family members and later set the man's house on fire.

They then allegedly proceeded to get hold of the 18-year old and unmoved by her screams and pleas for life, pushed the hapless into the raging fire.
