Crime, Rape
Description:
			In a shocking incident, three persons including an auto driver allegedly gang-raped a 20-year-old mentally challenged woman after beating her husband black and blue on the outskirts of Guntur city. 

The victim and her husband boarded an auto on the national highway around 11 pm on Thursday in which they were already two other passengers. After travelling for some distance, the driver took the auto into a bylane upon which the two passengers took advantage of the dark and severely assaulted Raju. Meanwhile, the auto driver forcibly took the woman into the nearby bushes and raped her. After beating Raju till he fell unconsciousness, the other two offenders too reached the spot and sexually assaulted the victim. The three then fled the scene in the early hours.

Initially, Guntur Urban Police did not believe their story and instead charged them with concocting the whole crime.
