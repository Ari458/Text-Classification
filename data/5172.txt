Description:
			Police on Friday arrested two persons for their alleged involvement in gang rape of a teenage girl of Ratanga village in Kandhamal district three days ago. They were identified as Badal Nayak, 18, of Dandapadara village and Gopinath Nayak, 22, of Ludukunda village under Daringbadi police limits.

SP (Kandhamal) K V Singh said efforts are on to nab four other accused, who are on the run.

Police said Badal and Gopinath kidnapped the 17-year-old from her village on Tuesday. They took her in a car to a nearby forest, where the other four were waiting and raped her. They fled the spot after committing the crime and the girl had to spend the night in the forest.

The following morning, villagers of Sarangagada spotted her and informed police. She was later handed over to her parents.

On Thursday, the girl lodged a police complaint, alleging that she was gang-raped. The personnel from the women assistance cell in the SP office arrested the two accused after she indentified them, police said.

"The other four too have been identified and will be nabbed soon," the SP added.
