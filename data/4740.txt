Murder, Dowry Harassment
Description:
			A RAW officer was on Wednesday sentenced to ten years rigorous imprisonment by a court in Bihar's Patna district which found him guilty of burning to death his wife for dowry in 2008.
Additional District and Sessions Judge-XI Anil Kumar Singh passed the order sentencing the officer, Manish Kumar Singh, to ten years RI and imposed a fine of Rs 5,000.
Singh, posted as RAW Deputy Field Officer at Danapur, had married in Kanpur on December 13, 2002.  His wife Shibu Singh was burnt to death at their house in Maurya Vihar locality near BMP 16 camp office under Phulwarisharif police station on August 21, 2008.  The victim's mother Kiran Rathore had lodged an FIR against her son in-law and five other family members accusing them of murdering her daughter for dowry.

The names of the five other accused were not in the charge sheet as their role in the murder case could not be proved by the investigators, according to the prosecution.
The complainant, a native of Kidwai Nagar locality in Kanpur, had alleged that her daughter was killed by her husband and in-laws after she failed to meet their demand for Rs ten lakh in cash. Rathore said that she had been told by her daughter two days before the incident that the money should be provided within a couple of days or she would be tortured.
Her son-in-law also allegedly told her that her daughter would be harmed if she failed to meet his demand.
