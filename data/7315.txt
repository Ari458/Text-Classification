Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			Police arrested a 55-year-old man and his 24-year-old son on Tuesday for allegedly sexually assaulting three minor girls in Pudukkottai. 

Durai alias Thokku, 55, a labourer, and his son D Prasath, 24, from Kamarajapuram in Pudukkottai were arrested by the all-women police. The father-son duo was booked under Sections 6 (aggravated penetrative sexual assault) and 9 (gang sexual assault) of Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. 

The duo had allegedly taken three Class 7 students of a government to a garden by offering lift on their bicycle and snacks to them. 

According to the complaint forwarded from the district collector office where the parents of the girls lodged their complaint, Durai and his son indulged in penetrative sexual assault on the girls by taking the girls to house of the duo from the school in the evening for three days. 

Police said the school teacher overheard the conversion of the three girls who discussed about going to the residence of the man to get chocolates from him. The innocent girls narrated the story of the father-son offering snacks and lift before touching their secret parts. 

Shocked by knowing about the incident, the teacher informed their parents who subsequently enquired with the girls who explained to them. The irate parents submitted a petition with the district administration who in turn ordered for a detailed inquiry by the police on Monday. 

After the investigation, AWPS police arrested the father and son and took them to the court this evening. The police said that they would be remanded by the court. The wife of the man died last year and he lived with his son. Meanwhile, the girls were sent for the medical examination at the government hospital in Pudukkottai.
