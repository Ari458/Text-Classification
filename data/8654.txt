Murder
Description:
			A 15-year-old girl was strangled and her body was set on fire by her unidentified murderers in east Delhi’s Gandhi Nagar area on Thursday. Police suspect that the girl was sexually assaulted before being killed. The area below her waist and above the knees was burnt, police said.

It is suspected that the killers did this to remove any evidence of sexual assault. The post-mortem report is awaited to determine the exact cause of death and find out if she was sexually assaulted. A case of murder has been registered at Gandhi Nagar police station. Police have detained two persons on suspicion and their questioning is on, sources said.

Police sent a forensic team to the victim's house and CCTV footage from the locality was being scanned. Police are also questioning relatives and her family's friends. 

Around 4 pm on Thursday, residents of Chandrapuri in Kailash Nagar spotted smoke coming out from the third floor of the building where the girl lived.

When they went up to enquire, they found the flat locked. The fire brigade and police were called in. Firefighters and police officers broke open the door and found the partially-burnt body of the class 9 student on a bed.

The girl used to live with her mother and brother. Her mother works at a garment factory and her brother is a computer designer.

Her neighbours said she usually returned from school around 2 pm. On Thursday her mother and brother were not at home when she came back from school.

It is alleged that the murderers knew that she would be alone at home. They apparently barged into the house, sexually assaulted her and then strangled her.
