Description:
			The Jarawa tribe have lived in peace in the Andaman Islands for thousands of years. Now tour companies run safaris through their jungle every day and wealthy tourists pay police to make the women - usually naked - dance for their amusement. This footage (Please click on the news source link to be taken to the video), filmed by a tourist, shows Jarawa women being told to dance by an off-camera police officer.
