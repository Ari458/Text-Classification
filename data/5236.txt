Dowry Harassment, Other
Description:
			In an alleged case of dowry death, a 31-year-old woman committed suicide in north Delhi Roop Nagar area on Sunday.
Claiming that it is a case of dowry death, the deceased's parents claimed that their daughter had been frequently harassed for money by her husband and in-laws.
According to the police, the deceased, identified as Ravneet Kaur, was married to one Sadeep Singh for the past 11 years.
On Sunday, at about 5 pm, deceased's father Narendra Singh received a call from Sadeep's uncle Manjeet Singh that Ravneet has committed suicide.
According to Mr Narendra Singh's statement to the police, before they could reach her house in Kamla Nagar, his daughter's body was taken from the house by the cops. It is a conspiracy as they didn't even wait for us to reach there, alleged deceased's father, adding that, I think even the police is not doing its job properly.
He has also alleged that Sadeep often would force Ravneet to ask for money from us to start a new business. The victim's father runs a machine manufacturing unit in Rohtak.
The police said that it has sent the body for autopsy and is investigating the case from every possible angle. We are questioning the family members and will also probe the case from angle of dowry death, said a senior police officer. Sadeep ran a bicycle factory in Wazirabad. The couple has two sons, eight and five.
