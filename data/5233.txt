Description:
			A 17-year-old intermediate student from Visakhapatnam, who ran away from home and landed in Hyderabad, was raped by an ice cream vendor at his house in Lower Tank Bund recently.

The victim, along with another female classmate, came to Hyderabad on July 27. As the two girls were roaming on Tank Bund, ice cream vendor Gangaraju noticed them on July 28 night and convinced them to take shelter at his house in Elchi Guda of Lower Tank Bund.

In the early hours of July 29, Gangaraju raped one of the girls and the next day, the two left his house. The girls were then given shelter by an old widow, who stays alone in the same locality. Locals became suspicious of the two girls staying with the old woman and on Monday, alerted the Gandhi Nagar police.

"We have registered a case under section 376 (rape) of the IPC and sent the victim for medical examination. The girls' parents were alerted and a man-hunt has been launched to nab Gangaraju, who is absconding," Gandhi Nagar inspector A Sanjeeva Rao said.
