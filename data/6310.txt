Description:
			A private tutor allegedly repeatedly raped a 13-year-old daughter of his landlord in the city, police said today.

The accused identified as Akshay Nagulkar was arrested yesterday, following a complaint lodged by the minor.

"The accused had taken a room on rent at the victim's house in Mangalwari area in northern part of the city in April last year to run coaching classes. In May last year, he first sexually assaulted the girl and thereafter raped her several times threatening her of dire consequences," a statement issued by police said.
