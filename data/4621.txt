Child Sexual Abuse
Description:
			The father of a six-year-old boy, hailing from an affluent Malad family, has been arrested for sexually abusing the child in Dubai and in Mumbai for over two years. The accused (36) has been sent to judicial custody. His counsel told TOI that the charges were "absolutely false".

The accused used to work in Dubai and after getting married in 2007, his wife too left India to move in with him. The couple had a child in 2008.

"In 2013, the family was watching a crime-based TV show, where sexual harassment of children was being discussed. The accused's wife, in an attempt to make her son aware, asked the boy if he had ever encountered a bad touch. At this, he said his father had sexually harassed him. His mother was taken aback at this but his father reprimanded him," said a police official.

The mother then decided to speak to her son in private. The boy told her that he was being sexually abused by his father since the past several months but hadn't told her anything. His mother took him to a Dubai hospital, which confirmed the abuse. She took a second opinion, which again confirmed the abuse. But she decided against approaching the Dubai police and left for Mumbai with her son.

However, in early 2014, the accused got a job posting in Mumbai and moved in with his wife and son. In April, he sexually abused his son once again. On learning about it from her son, the accused's wife approached the police and registered a complaint on April 19.
