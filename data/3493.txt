Murder, Rape
Description:
			The 45-year-old man who allegedly raped and murdered his teenage daughter for eloping from their hometown in Uttar Pradesh, not only made his friend brutalize her and watched on but also made him repeat the act, apparently "to teach her a lesson".

After the girl's body was recovered from the jungles of Dachkulpada in Kashimira, where she was murdered on October 31, an autopsy was conducted. The report confirms that the girl (17) was sexually assaulted before being strangled but it refutes the father's claim to the police that she was pregnant.

The victim was the eldest among three siblings. Four months ago, she eloped with her 19-year-old neighbour from Komalpur in Ghazipur. After a wedding in a temple, the couple had been living at Uttan in Bhayander (W). When the girl secretly started calling up her mother, the father got the wind of it and managed to get her Bhayander address. Two weeks ago, he came to the city and traced her to Uttan. He, along with a friend, who lived at Dachkulpada Road in Kashimira, went to the girl's home and tried to force her to return to Uttar Pradesh. When she refused to listen to him, her father and his friend dragged her to the jungles of Dachkulpada. There the father raped the girl "to teach her a lesson" and then made his friend to brutalize her, while he watched. After the friend was done with the act, the father forced him to brutalize his daughter again. Fearing that the girl might report them to the police, the two strangled her with a dupatta.

The crime came to light after the father, in a drunken stupor, told a waiter at a Bhayander hotel about the rape and killing. They were gathering the clothes the accused wore while committing the crime. The police have still not been able to trace the girl's boyfriend, a labourer, who apparently fled when the accused first visited their Uttan home.
