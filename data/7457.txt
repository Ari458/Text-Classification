Child Sexual Abuse, Rape, Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			An auto driver was arrested for sexually assaulting a four-year-old girl at Palarivattom on Friday. The accused, Thomas George (50) of Chalikavattom, was working as an auto driver in the area, ferrying children to and from the school.

The incident happened 10 days ago when the accused was dropping the girl, an LKG student and a resident of Ponnurunni, to a playschool around 3.15pm. According to the statement given by the child to the police, the accused allegedly sexually assaulted the child before dropping her off at the playschool.

According to police, the child refused to travel by the auto the next morning. But the parents, who didn't suspect any foul play, insisted the child to go in the same auto. She continued travelling by the same vehicle.

The incident finally came to light a few days after the child developed a urinary infection and complained of pain in her private parts. The medical examination confirmed that the girl was sexually abused. When asked by her parents, the child narrated the incident and identified the auto driver.

A case has been registered at Palarivattom station after parents contacted Childline officials who then informed the police on Thursday.

Thomas was arrested by the Ernakulam north circle inspector Shiju P S on Friday afternoon and was booked for rape. A potency test was conducted before he was produced before the magistrate. He was remanded in judicial custody for 14 days.

According to police, this was not the first instance of sexual abuse committed by the accused.

"A few people have now come forward stating that the accused had previously attempted to sexually abuse a woman and another child in his area of residence, but the survivors are yet to register cases against him," a police officer said.
