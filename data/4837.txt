Molestation, Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			An ayurvedic doctor in Udhna has been booked for allegedly sexually harassing and threatening his female employee.

Prakash Barvaliya, a resident of Varachha area, was booked for sexual harassment of the woman working as a receptionist in his clinic. In her complaint, the woman stated that she was appointed at Barvaliya's clinic around two months ago. Few days back, Barvaliya started sending her text SMSs late in the evening when she left the clinic.

"Initially, the doctor used to inquire through the SMS about the time she left and other routine work. The girl thought it was normal but gradually the accused started getting too personal. He proposed the girl and invited her to start a relationship with him three days ago," said A H Rajput, police inspector, Udhna.

"The shocked woman did not reply. Barvaliya then called her in the office on Tuesday afternoon. He asked the girl why she did not reply and tried to hug her," said Rajput.

While talking to her, he touched her inappropriately and asked for sexual favours. When she rejected, he allegedly threatened to sack her from the job. She narrated the incident to her parents and lodged a complaint with Udhna police station late on Tuesday night.

Police have launched a hunt for Barvaliya, who was not found at his house on Wednesday morning.
