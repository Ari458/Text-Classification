Molestation, Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			On September 7, accounts tutor Vijay Sinha, who runs a coaching school on Thakurbari Road in Sakchi, had allegedly tried to rape the college girl after his other students had left. The day after, a case under Sections 376 (rape or attempt to rape) and 354 (assault or use of criminal force on a woman with the intent to outrage her modesty) of the IPC was lodged against him.

While the tutor has since been threatening the girl to withdraw the case by sending goons to her Mango residence, family members, in their memorandum to the SSP on Tuesday, claimed that police were not doing enough to arrest him.

"She is in a state of shock. The accused is still at large and she is afraid to step out of home," said a family member and added that city DSP Animesh Nathani had summoned the girl on Monday. "After recording her statement, he drew an absurd conclusion that there was no evidence of any rape attempt."

He pointed out that if the SSP ensured her deposition before a judicial magistrate under Section 164 of the CrPC, then perhaps justice would be delivered.

Sakchi OC Anjani Kumar Tiwary said he had joined only on Monday and could not comment on the case.

DSP Nathani denied the charges against him, but contended that the girl's statement wasn't enough. "We will talk to her tuition mates and probe deeper because the case demands the same," he said.

SSP Mathew was not in office during the protest.
