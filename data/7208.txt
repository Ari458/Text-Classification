Child Sexual Abuse, Molestation
Description:
			The Tulinj police have arrested a 49-year-old bachelor, for allegedly molesting a seven-year-old girl at his home on Sunday night on the pretext of giving her a bicycle.

The incident took place in a posh complex in Moregaon of Nalasopara East. The teen sister of the victim saw her inside the flat of real estate agent Harry Wilson, who is known in the neighbourhood as Harry Potter for hanging around children and playing with them, and complained to her mother about it.

"When the girl's mother asked her why she was in his flat, she told her the accused took her inside, undressed her and kissed her private parts," said an officer. "As soon as we registered the complaint, we picked him up from his residence and took him into custody. The girl has suffered trauma because of the incident. He is said to have molested her twice."

Investigating officer Montyraj Khopkar said, "We have arrested him under section 354 (molestation) of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act."

"We will produce him in Vasai court. We suspect there might be more children who will come forward now with similar allegations."
