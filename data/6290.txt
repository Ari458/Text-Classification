Description:
			A woman has been arrested for allegedly holding a 19-year-old girl as hostage and sexually assaulting her, police said here today.

According to police, the girl has lodged a complaint against a woman whom she met while on a visit to her elder sister in Rewari, eight months back.

Accused took the girl into confidence and promised to provide her with class tenth pass certificate on a condition that the latter provide a sum of 1500 rupees, two photographs and must be willing to go to Pratapgarh with her.

The victim went to Pratapgarh with the accused where she was sexually abused and was threatened to be killed if she informed anyone, police said.

One month afterwards, the accused woman allegedly took the victim to Jaipur on the pretext of filling up a form where she locked the girl in a room at a local restaurant. The victim has alleged that she was intoxicated by the accused there and sexually abused on a daily basis. The accused used to lock her from outside, as per the victim's complaint.

Around 27 days later, the accused returned to Rewari and abandoned the girl at a tea shop there. The girl then went to a police station and registered her complaint.

She was taken home by her sister and brother-in-law, where accused Meena called her after some time and threatened to leak her obscene video clip.

A few days later, accused woman attempted to kidnap the girl along with an unidentified man on a motorcycle, a bid which was foiled by the local people as they overpowered the duo after hearing the victim's cries for help.

The accused were then handed over to the police who have booked the woman under various sections of IPC, while further investigation in the case is on.
