Her husband who is an ex-cadre of a UG group was always asking Tina to bring money from her parents.

Tina said that she was not given food at times forcing her to beg food from the neighbourhood.

Even though people of the neighbourhood were sympathetic to the young woman, she was beaten every now and then by her in-laws on the charge of roaming in the neighbourhood.

"Unable to witness the atrocity meted out to me, some people of the neighbourhood called my family over phone to take me back", Tina recounted.
