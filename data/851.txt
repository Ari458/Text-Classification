Description:
			The Accused Kalia Sahu alias Kalu got married to Jyoshna Rani Sahu (35), 10 years ago. According to Sources, after few days of marriage, their dispute started over dowry demands. When Kalu axed his wife to death following an argument, he lost his mental balance and also killed his two-year-old son Pabitra when he cried on seeing his mother being attacked. 

Deceased Jyoshna's brother Narayan said Kalu was always pestering Jyotsna for dowry and it was the main cause behind persistent family feud, which ended with the heinous act on Saturday night. On the other hand, Kalu said his wife indulged in adultery in his absence which was unbearable for him.
