Description:
			Seven years after he raped a woman near Kadaba after promising to marry her, a labourer Sundara  was on Wednesday found guilty of sexual assault and cheating by the Sixth Additional District and Sessions Court.

The incident was reported on November 7, 2009. A 24-year-old woman accused the 31-year-old Sundara of raping her after promising of marrying her. The woman told the police that Sundara, a distant relative, befriended her during his many visits to her house while he was working as a construction labourer in the vicinity.

Following the sexual assault, the woman became pregnant. After Sundara refused to marry her, the woman lodged a police complaint. A few weeks later, she gave birth to a child. The Kadaba police arrested Sundara and filed a charge-sheet before the Judicial Magistrate First Class, Puttur, charging him under Section 417 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code.

After recording the girl's statement, the Puttur Magistrate found substance to charge him under Section 376 (sexual assault) and referred the case for trial to the District Sessions Court.

Public Prosecutor Judith O.M. Crasta examined 10 witnesses, including DNA expert P.R. Kumari, who, after carrying out DNA analysis of the blood samples of the child and Sundara, concluded that he was the biological father.

Sundara was pronounced guilty on both charges on Wednesday. The quantum of his punishment will be announced on Thursday.
