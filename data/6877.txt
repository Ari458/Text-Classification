Description:
			Body of a teenaged girl was found in jungles of Balampur ghati on Bhopal Vidisha Road in Bhopal district. She was murdered and body was burnt there. 

Whether she was raped before strangled to death will get clear after autopsy report. A case was registered at Sukhi Sewania police station. Identity of the dead is yet to be ascertained. 

IPS officer on probation, SHO Sukhi Sewania police station, Vinayak Verma told TOI the body was recovered around 8.30 am. It was partially burnt. The body appears to be around 12 to 14 hours old. There were drag marks suggesting she was strangled to death elsewhere and the body was dumped here. 

Ornaments of iron and copper were found on the body, besides, cash worth Rs 3,000 in denomination of five hundred rupee currency notes was found in blouse. Prima facie it appears a crime of passion. Police stations of nearby areas have been alerted to ascertain identity at the earliest, Verma added. 

The dead appeared between 17 and 19 years of age. Possibility of murder after rape was not ruled out, but police pointed there were proper clothes on body, including undergarments. 

A forest guard told police of spotting flames in the area around 8.30 pm on Wednesday, indicating the body was burnt that time. But the guard did not take it seriously thinking the fire would die down soon.
