Domestic Violence, Dowry Harassment
Description:
			Around three months after the death of a newlywed woman, the police arrested her husband and mother-in-law on Tuesday. The arrests came after the deceased's father accused the family of dowry harassment and grave negligence in regards to her treatment, which resulted in 'several complications'. 

The Daba police have registered a case under sections 498 A (Dowry harassment) and 304 A (causing death by negligence) against Varinder Singh Toor of Gurpal Nagar and his mother Paramjit Kaur and arrested them on Tuesday.

The case has been registered following the statement of deceased's father Manmohan Singh of Gurpreet Nagar.

In his complaint, Manmohan Singh said his daughter Asha, 23, was married to Varinder Singh Toor on February 21, 2014. He further added that after the marriage, her in-laws had started harassing her for dowry.

Her husband Varinder Singh had bit on Asha's chest that caused infection and led to further complications. Her in-laws ignored her medical condition following which the infection got worse. He got his daughter treated from several hospitals, but she died on May 15.

Sub-Inspector Rajwant Pal Singh, who is investigating the matter, said a case has been registered following an inquiry conducted by the additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP, city 2). He added that the police arrested the accused on Tuesday.
