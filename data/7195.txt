			The police on Wednesday arrested three persons for allegedly gang-raping a Class X tribal student at Garakumpa village in Kandhamal district on Friday.

Daily-wage labourers Chittaranjan Kanhar, 26, Rajib Lochan Kanhar, 20, and Prabhat Kanhar, 29, of the same village were held after undergoing medical test.

The survivor cleared her annual high school certificate examination this year, said sub-divisional police officer (Phulbani) Prabhat Panigrahi.

The trio kidnapped the 16-year-old girl while she was returning home after attending a feast. They took her to a nearby jungle, about one km from the village, and took turns to rape her, police said.

On the next morning, she went to her sister's house at Salapa village in the district. After returning home, she narrated about the incident to her mother, who lodged an FIR in Khajuripada police station on Tuesday.

"We picked up all the accused from their houses and medical examination was conducted on them at the district headquarters hospital at Phulbani," Panigrahi said.
