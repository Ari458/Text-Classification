Domestic Violence, Dowry Harassment
Description:
			The Koregaon Park police on Friday arrested a 29-year-old finance broker and his father from Boat Club Road and charged them under sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for allegedly subjecting the broker's 24-year-old wife to severe cruelty over the issue of not meeting their dowry demands.

Police have also booked the broker's mother and sister for allegedly abetting the crime. A magisterial court has released the father and son on bail.

Subhash Aniruddha, senior inspector of the Koregaon Park police station, said that the couple married on February 23, but the relations between them soon turned sour over the issue.

In her complaint to the police, the woman has alleged that her parents had spent Rs 70 lakh on the marriage and had also given them dowry.

However, her husband and her in-laws continued to harass her for not meeting their other demands like purchasing a new car, Aniruddha said.

He said that the broker and his family members suspected her character, thrashed, abused and harassed her physically and mentally for not doing household work. They threw her out of the house after her parents did not meet their dowry demands, he added.

The woman registered a complaint with the police after efforts to reunite with her husband proved futile.
