Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			Torrent Pharmaceuticals has sacked a top executive after he was found guilty of sexually harassing a woman colleague. "An internal inquiry was carried out, which concluded that the allegations were true. Otherwise an efficient employee, the top executive was immediately shown the door," said a Torrent official on condition of anonymity.

Last year, another Ahmedabad-based pharma major had taken a similar step against a senior HR executive after complaints of sexual harassment against him.
