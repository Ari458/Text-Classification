Rape
Description:
			A sessions court at the Mirzapur rural court campus on Friday granted temporary bail to a deaf and mute rape accused to wed his 24-year old neighbour, who is the rape survivor and is also disabled like the accused. The prisoner, Nagar Hirabhai Anajara from Dholera village is behind bars on allegations of raping the very girl he is going to marry. The application for bail was filed by the bride's sister, informing the court that both parties have come to a compromise in this case.

During the hearing of the bail plea, principal district judge P R Patel questioned the applicant about whether there was pressure on the victim to enter a compromise with the accused.The applicant submitted that here was no pressure or compulsion on her sister. The court ordered the release of the accused on bail till December 28, for his wedding.

Anajara was held in January on complaint by the deaf and mute girl's father, who had then learned about his daughter's pregnancy. Later, the girl's father passed away. Her mother had died in 2008. After she delivered a girl child, the baby was sent to a women's protection home as the mother was not in a condition to look after her alone.
