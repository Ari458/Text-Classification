Description:
			The district and sessions court of Aizawl convicted a 70-year-old man for the rape and murder of a minor and sentenced him to life.

In a recent judgment, district and sessions judge R Thanga convicted B Lalrinmawia, a resident of North Vanlaiphai village along the Myanmar border, to undergo rigorous imprisonment for life and submit a fine of Rs 5,000 for murdering an 8-year-old girl of the same village.

The judge ordered that Lalrinmawia would have to undergo additional two months' imprisonment in case he fails to pay the fine. Lalrinmawia was convicted under Section 377 of the IPC and awarded three years' imprisonment and a fine of Rs 2,000. He would serve the sentences concurrently, said the judge.
