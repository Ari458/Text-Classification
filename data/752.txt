Description:
			Asma had been married to Sajid from Hubli, about 4 years back. Reportedly, their marital relationship had soured of late. On Wednesday, her parents received a call, stating that Asma had become ill. By the time the close relatives reached Hubli, she had breathed her last. Although the in-laws of Asma claimed it to be a case of suicide, they did not register any police complaint. Asma's relatives brought the body here.
