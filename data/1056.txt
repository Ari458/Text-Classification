Abuse
Description:
			On May 23, 2008 , both the accused abused the victim and tore her dress. Subsequently, Severely attacked the victim with an iron rod on her forehead.

But i cant understand this logic:
"Considering the fact that Agnelo is the only earning member of his family and his son being a young man, the court noted that sentencing them to pay fine would meet the ends of justice and would have deterrent effect."
