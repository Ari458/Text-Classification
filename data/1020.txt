Description:
			The school had organised a trip to a nearby picnic spot at Bettadala on Dec 20.
It was on this occasion that the teacher tried to touch her and make sexual advances towards her. The girl claimed that the teacher called her to a lonely place, but she rejected his offer. The girl also maintained that the teacher used to make advances towards her since a year. She had given up sports because of the teacher and was facing mental torture. The teacher had threatened her that if she did not listen to him, she would fail in her exams.
