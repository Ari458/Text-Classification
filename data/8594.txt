Abduction, Abuse
Description:
			Rape on a garment worker of Malur taluk in Kolar district has come to light six days after the crime was committed, after the accused threatened the victim.

According to Masti police, who have registered a case, an 18-year-old young woman was reportedly abducted by Anand (28) when she was returning home in Malur from the garment factory on Sunday evening. It is said that Anand, who is married, sexually assaulted her at his mulberry farm. He allegedly threatened to kill the victim if she revealed the incident.

The police said the young woman did not reveal the incident to anyone. However, when the accused went near her house on Friday and threatened her again, she informed her parents.

The young woman later filed a complaint with the Masti police. She has now been admitted to the government hospital in the town for medical examination.

Two teams have been formed to nab the accused, the police added.
