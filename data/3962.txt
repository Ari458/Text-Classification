Description:
			In a yet another case of molestation of a child, a 65-year-old man was arrested for allegedly molesting a six-year-old girl in Aadarsh Nagar locality on Tuesday evening. The police have promptly arrested the accused though he managed to escape after the incident.

The incident took place when the mother of the girl went for shopping. Noticing that girl was alone, the man, Inderjeet Singh, who was residing in same house as tenant in Guru Nanakpura locality, barged into the house and started misbehaving. "While he was molesting the girl, one of the relatives of the girl came and saw the man attempting rape. The accused soon rushed out and fled from the scene," said an officer of Aadarsh Nagar area on Wednesday.

Since it was a matter of minor girl, police swung into action after the complaint of the mother and arrested the man. "We have lodged a case under Section 4 of Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSOA) Act and also under Section 377 of IPC since the accused was attempting unnatural sex," the officer added.

With this case the police have re-issued orders to the station house officers concerned to ensure further registrations of tenants residing in various colonies.
