Description:
			the boy and girl were playing last Wednesday afternoon when 25-year-old Kanojia, who works at a laundry close to their home, lured the girl away from her brother by offering her chocolates. "Kanojia took the minor to a deserted alley adjacent to his workplace and allegedly forced himself on her. Not satisfied with the trauma he inflicted on her, he demanded that the girl send her brother to him. The scared girl mutely complied and Kanojia escorted the five-year-old to the same alley and sodomised him

The parents had kept the issue hidden all this time owing to social embarrassment and hence had not reported the case to the police
