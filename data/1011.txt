Description:
			The couple is living separately as they have had differences since their marriage took place last year. Over last few months, she started getting emails and messages on her Facebook accounts from two unknown ids. She immediately grew suspicious and approached the cops. During investigations it was found tht Chirayush Shah (ex husband) had created these fake ids and was trying to tarnish her image on the social networking website by posting lewd pictures

Many guys are not aware that no matter how much care they take into creating such fake ids, it is just a matter of hours for a cyber cell investigation team to crack their identities and arrest them. Earlier this month a 22 yr old Engineering student from Chennai was arrested for the same.
