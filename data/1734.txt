Rape, Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			Case has been registered against a Senior Education department official for allegedly raping and torturing a government teacher for more than five years. 

The woman, a divorcee who has a daughter as well, has alleged that the Education official has been raping her since 2006. 

“He was posted at different places in Haryana and he made sure that I too was transferred so that he could use me,” she told police in her complaint. 

She said all these years she had been silent because the official threatened her that she would lose her job if she went to police or complained to anybody about the rape and torture. 

But in April this year, she lodged a complaint with the police commissioner against the official, who was suspended some time ago for an alleged case of cheating. 

She alleged that police failed to take action, forcing her to approach a city court. The court directed police to lodge a case and investigate the matter. 

“Even now, he and his aides send me vulgar messages, abuse and ask me to withdraw the case or else he will harm my family,” she alleged. 

Police said they are investigating the case, and would check call records and other details.
