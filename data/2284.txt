Description:
			Six minor girls were rescued today along the Assam-Bhutan border when they were on their way to Gujarat for allegedly being sold there for sex trade.

The girls aged 12-15 years were rescued by the people of Moranjana village who suspected foul play by two persons- Parbati Barman and Haricharan Boro - who were escorting the girls.

The two escorts were held by the people and handed over to police and the girls sent back to their families.

The girls belonging to poor families of the tea tribe community were taken from their Paharpur village in Kamrup district by a vehicle for boarding a train to Gujarat from Moranjana.

They were lured on the promise of jobs in companies and offices at good salaries that they could send back home.

Another person, Safiqul Islam, accompanying the girls is absconding and police has launched a search operation to nab him.

Parbati and Haricharan confessed before the police that they would regularly take both minor girls and boys from Assam for sale in Gujarat.
