Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			Days after two dalit girls were gang-raped and murdered in Badaun, Bareilly district has witnessed another rape on a 16-year-old girl at Kanchanpura village of Bhojipura tehsil on Tuesday afternoon.

The rape survivor and her younger sister went to the nearby fields around noon. While her sister halted mid-way to guard, the survivor went deeper into the fields to answer her nature call. It was here that the accused, identified as Rahul, was waiting for her with a tamancha (country-made gun).

The girl said the accused allegedly threatened to shoot her when she tried to raise an alarm. After raping her, she claims, the accused pointed his gun at her and warned her of dire consequences if she reported the incident to the police. The girl, however, went home and informed her family.

The police have lodged an FIR against the absconding accused under Section 365 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and PASCO (Protection of Child from Sexual Offence) Act. The girl has been sent for a medical examination to a district hospital in Bareilly.

Meanwhile, the investigating officer, Digamber Khuswaha, said: "The girl and the accused (both residents of the same village) had known each other for some time. She was pressing him to marry her but the accused was avoiding it. This could be a reason behind the incident."

Khuswaha added that the accused was absconding but would be arrested shortly.
