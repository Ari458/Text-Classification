Molestation
Description:
			The body of a class IX student of a government-run high school was found hanging at her residence today after she was allegedly molested by a youth in Jajpur district.

The 15-year old was suspected to have killed self after the neighbour Rajan Bhoi (20) allegedly outraged her modesty when she was way back home after having bath.

Rajan was caught by villagers, tied to a tree as the terrified girl screamed for help.

In a shocking turn of events, the girl then locked herself in at home with her daily wage-earner parents away and her hanging body recovered later on.

The girl, a brilliant student, felt anguished as villagers gathered around the youth and beat him up and the news spread about her humiliation, a senior district police officer said.
