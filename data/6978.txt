Street Harassment
Description:
			A 27-year-old man was arrested for harassing a college girl at Kovilpalayam on the outskirts of the city on Wednesday. Police said M Vijayakumar of Kottaipalayam near Kovilpalayam who works at a lathe workshop in the same locality was infatuated with A Nanditha, 20, a final year B Com student at a private college in Peelamedu. But Nanditha spurned his advances and asked him not to disturb her. Vijayakumar kept harassing the girl, forcing him to accept his proposal.

Unable to bear his torture, her parents decided to get her married. But Vijayakumar would assault the prospective bridegrooms and their family members when they visited Nanditha's house. Three cases were filed against him at the Kovilpalayam police and he was already arrested for the assault cases last year.

On Tuesday morning, the girl was waiting at the Kovilpalayam bus stand, when Vijayakumar approached her and asked her to marry him. On denying his proposal, Vijayakumar verbally abused Nanditha and threatened her. She lodged a complaint

and Vijayakumar was arrested on Wednesday. He was produced before a judicial magistrate court and remanded to judicial custody.
