Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A man, who raped a girl after impersonating as a government employee implementing a scheme for the girl child, has been sentenced to life imprisonment by a Delhi court, which said his act was “most cruel and gruesome”. 

The court refused to show leniency to him, noting that he has already been convicted in a similar case by another court and in this matter, he raped an eight-year-old girl when he was out on bail in the previous case. 

Additional Sessions Judge Illa Rawat also said that convict Anwarul Haque, being the father of two daughters, ought to have refrained from such a conduct which has spoilt the entire life of a young girl and no leniency is called for in the matter. 

“It, thus, appears that the fact that the convict is a father of two minor daughters did not deter him from repeating a sexual offence with a minor girl and an offence of similar nature as in the present case, after being released on bail, in the (previous) case. 

“In these circumstances, the acts of the convict can only be concluded to be most cruel and gruesome considering the submissions that he has two minor daughters of his own,” the court said and imposed a fine of Rs11,000 on Anwar. 

It directed the Delhi Government to pay a compensation of Rs200,000 to the victim for her welfare and rehabilitation under the ‘Restoration and Compensatory Justice’ scheme. According to the police, in June 2010, Anwar had come to the minor’s house in Shakurpur in northwest Delhi impersonating as a government employee implementing the Ladli Yozna for the welfare of the girl child. 

Anwar, who introduced himself as Imran, had told the child’s mother that he had come to collect the form of Ladli Yojna in which clothes and money are given to girls.
