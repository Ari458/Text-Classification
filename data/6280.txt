Description:
			A baby girl was found dead outside her house in Ranga Reddy district of Telangana, police said here today.

Some residents of Akkampalli village found the body of one-year-old baby this morning, with a rope around her neck indicating strangulation, lying near a woman with her legs and hands tied, a senior police official said.

The incident took place last night when one N Narasimhalu, along with one more person, went to the house of a 25-year-old woman, with whom he allegedly had an illicit affair, Tandur Town DSP Sheikh Ismail said.

The woman was then allegedly beaten up by the duo and was dragged along with her one-year-old baby girl outside the house.

Later in the morning, some villagers found the baby dead with a rope around her neck and informed the police.

The villagers also found some lemons and turmeric powder spread around the baby's body and suspected that she might have been killed through black magic, the DSP said.

"The two men are at large. The woman said she had fainted and is not aware what exactly happened. Whether it is an act of sorcery and who killed the girl, investigation are on," he said.
