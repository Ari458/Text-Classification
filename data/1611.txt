Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			Mumbai police commissioner has suspended police inspector Dilip Mangaonkar and constable Ashok Valekar of the Vinoba Bhave (VB) Nagar police station, Kurla (West), for allegedly outraging the modesty of probationary sub-inspector Trupti Borate.

In her complaint to the police commissioner, Borate alleged that Mangonkar sent her lewd SMSes and passed frequent sexual comments about her. He visited her home often and harassed her in the office, calling her a look-alike of film actress Isha Koppikar and saying she should have joined the modelling world instead of the police force. 

This harassment was a regular occurrence since January, 2012. Finally, fed up with the torture, she mustered courage and lodged a complaint against the duo with the commissioner in March.
