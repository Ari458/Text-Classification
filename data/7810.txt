Rape, Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			Two construction workers were arrested on Wednesday for allegedly sexually assaulting a co-worker near Maanur on Tuesday.

Police said the 40-year-old woman from Kaanaarpatti near Maanur was getting ready to return home on Tuesday evening after the end of the day's work at Thirumalaapuram. When Maasaanam (30) and Poomaari (25), both from Thirumalaapuram and were working along with her, told her that they would drop her at Kaanaarpatti as they were going to Tirunelveli on their two-wheeler, and she agreed.

Instead of going to Kaanaarpatti, they took her to a secluded place near Thirumalaapuram and sexually assaulted her.

On a complaint from her, a case was registered at Palayamkottai All Women Police Station.
