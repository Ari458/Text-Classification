Description:
			A 16-year old girl was allegedly gang-raped by her neighbour and three of his friends at Swarupnagar in North 24-Parganas. The main accused was arrested.

The family members of the rape survivor lodged a complaint against 25-year-old Jahangir Mondal and three others at Swarupnagar police station. Mondal was produced in Bashirhat sub-divisional court. He was remanded for five days.

The incident took place around 8.30pm when the teenager, a Class IX student, was on her way back home with another girl after attending a religious programme at Kantabagan, barely 1 km from her house at Umapatipur. Mondal offered a ride to the girls on his bike and assured to drop them home. When they reached Kantabagan Park, he allegedly drove to a desolate place and called three youths over. They promptly arrived on another bike.

They approached them for sexual favours. When they refused, they attacked them and tried to rape them both. The friend managed to flee but she couldn't as they had held her down. They took turns to rape her. The girl's friend contacted some locals who later found her near a bush in a semi-conscious state, barely clothed. She was taken to Baduria state general hospital and discharged after treatment.

The girl's father lodged a complaint with Swarupnagar police.

The girl was sent for medical test.
