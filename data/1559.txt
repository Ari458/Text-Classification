Description:
			The criminals, numbering about 10 shot dead a 26 year old woman after allegedly raping her on Sikandra-Sheikhpura road in Lakhi-sarai district.

Her husband alleged that she was raped by the assailants, who went on to rob her and her husband, before opening fire. Naresh said she suffered injuries in the firing by the criminals. He added that Suman was taken to a hospital in Jamui in a critical condition around 2.30am. Doctors in the hospital said she was dead by then, her husband said. 

About two-to-three criminals dragged her away, while the rest in the gang were busy looting our belongings. Within a few minutes, we heard gunshots. On rushing to the area from where the sound came, we saw her lying in a pool of blood,Naresh said.
