Sexual Harassment at Work, Street Harassment
Description:
			A constable attached to the Thane city police has been arrested for stalking and harassing a 21-year-old woman from Balkum. 

Chandrakant Tupe (32) of Majiwada is said to have been following her for the last few days and once, allegedly tried to start a conversation with her. 

"In her complaint the woman has said she was in queue at the SATIS deck on Tuesday when Tupe came by and started a conversation. But when she ignored him, he held her hand in public view. The girl panicked and resisted," police said. 

Tupe then flashed his photograph in police uniform and threatened her with arrest for resisting an on-duty policeman. 

"The woman raised an alarm and other passengers came to her rescue and handed over the accused to the police. We have arrested him and are investigating," said the Thane Nagar police. 

Tupe has been booked under Sections 354 (a)(d) and 506 (Punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code. The incident is yet another stark instance of the misuse of authority by men in khaki. Last week, two cops from Mumbra police station were arrested for sexually abusing a minor, while suspended DIG Sunil Paraskar is accused of alleged molestation and rape by a Mumbai model.
