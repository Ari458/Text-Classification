Crime, Dowry Harassment
Description:
			In a shocking incident, a man allegedly pushed his wife and son into a village well in Bihar's Jamui district over dowry, leading to their deaths.

Apparently infuriated with his in-laws for not meeting his dowry demands, the accused, Sanjay Yadav, pushed his wife Dulari Devi (22) and son Anand Kumar (10 months) into a well at his wife's parental home under Chandramandi police station.

The mother-son duo drowned in the well from where their bodies were later recovered and sent for post-mortem.
