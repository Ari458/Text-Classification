Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A 16-year-old girl was allegedly gang-raped by two of her neighbours at Timarpur, north Delhi. The accused, identified as Kapil (23) and Krishnan (21) were arrested from the spot. 

The incident took place near Nehru Vihar when the survivor was returning home after her tuitions. She alleged that the two men, who were her neighbours, met her on the way and persuaded her to follow them to a secluded place. They then forced her into a bush and raped her.

The survivor managed to raise an alarm, following which Kapil was chased and caught by a police official who was nearby and had heard survivor's call for help. Krishnan also tried to flee the spot but was caught by the locals and was handed over to the cops. 

The survivor was taken for a medical check up which confirmed rape. A case has been registered under IPC section 376 against Kapil, who is a carpenter and Krishnan who works at a stationary shop. 

The girl was dropout from a local school and had known the two accused for some time and has not complained about being harassed by the duo earlier. Police are questioning the friends and family members of the girl and the two accused in this regard.
