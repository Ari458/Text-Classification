Dowry Harassment
Description:
			The girl who danced brilliantly on one leg and left everyone spellbound by her stupendous performance that many cannot deliver even on both the legs, is in news again. But this time not for her dance performance, but because she has accused her husband of cheating, demanding dowry and harassment. The second runner-up of dance reality show India's Got Talent, Shubreet Kaur, has filed a complaint against her husband Yash Makkad accusing him of repeatedly demanding money from her and resorting to lies to marry her. Kaur said that her husband has been harassing her for money, alleging that he cheated her. Kaur said that her husband had demanded dowry at the time of marriage and has been continuously harassing her for money time and again. In CCTV footage obtained from a gym, Makkad is seen pushing her out when Shubreet went to visit him on July 22.
