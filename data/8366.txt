Rape
Description:
			A 20-year-old woman moved police against her mother's live-in partner, alleging he had raped her. The victim approached the court of the chief judicial magistrate, accusing Omprakash Kalkal, the former president of Charkhi Dadri bar association, of raping her. The CJM called Sector 5 police, who took her for medical examination which confirmed rape.

Police said, in her complaint, the woman said she hailed from Bhiwani. Her mother had brought her to Gurgaon in 2012, after her father's death in 2008. Here, the mother fell in love with the accused and started living with him. The 20-year-old claimed the man raped her on December 15 last year , after which she had registered a complaint at the Khandsa Road police chowki. But the police took no action.

"We've lodged an FIR and are investigating the case," said inspector Shailender Singh.
