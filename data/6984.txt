Rape
Description:
			A recently inducted constable in the Goa police was booked for rape on Tuesday. The Panjim police are investigating into a complaint against Akshay Gawas, 21, attached to Ponda police station for sexually exploiting a young girl on the pretext of marriage.
As per the complaint, the constable met the victim through a social networking site two years ago. “They exchanged chat messages and eventually ended up meeting each other. He lured her into marriage and developed a physical relationship with her,” a police official said. 
The department is yet to take disciplinary action against him whilst his arrest is likely soon.
The Goa police have earned bad reputation in the recent past with the latest examples being corruption in the police training school involving SP Atmaram Deshpande, and extortion case against the now-suspended PI Sandesh Chodankar and head constable Shatun Shetye.
