Description:
			Police on Thursday arrested a man for allegedly blackmailing a 27-year-old woman, demanding sexual favours. The suspect had used morphed photographs of the woman as leverage.

After the terrified woman lodged a complaint, the Sinhagad Road police arrested the suspect, a 26-year-old air-conditioner mechanic, under section 354 (A) (demand or request for sexual favours) of the Indian Penal Code as well as the relevant sections of the Information and Technology Act.

A police officer told TOI that the suspect, who hails from Ahmednagar district, has been acquainted with the woman for a few years. "He photographed the woman without her knowledge," the officer said.

The suspect then allegedly morphed those photographs and in August, forwarded them to his victim and started blackmailing her. "The suspect demanded sexual favours from her in return for not showing these photographs to her husband," the policeman said.

When the woman rejected him the suspect sent her husband the photographs. "The suspect blackmailed her for three months. When he threatened to forward the photos to her relatives and upload them to social networking sites, the women lodged the complaint on Wednesday," the officer added.
