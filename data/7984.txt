Rape
Description:
			The police, on Wednesday, arrested a Non-Resident Keralite hailing from Nadapuram under section 376 (punishment for rape) of the Indian Penal Code. P. Mohammedali, the accused in the case, was nabbed following a written petition filed by a housewife from the region.

According to the police, the man sexually abused the woman after taking her to a rented house. He was produced before the Nadapuram Judicial First Class Magistrate Court and remanded in judicial custody.

The arrest of the man also prompted the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) to reconsider the candidature of his mother to the local body election. According to party sources, the IUML leadership selected another woman, K.K. Najma, at the last minute to contest from ward number 2 in Nadapuram panchayat.

Last term, it was one of the few wards where the Communist Party of India (Marxist) candidates won the elections. The party was not willing to make an experiment in the wake of an undesired incident, a source said.
