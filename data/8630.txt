Murder
Description:
			A 48-year-old man chopped the body of a woman into more than 12 pieces after she threatened to lodge a rape complaint with police in Shahdol district.

Her body parts were found strewn near railway tracks and also in his backyard on July 24. Accused Ram Kishore Yadav, a Railways employee was produced in court on Tuesday.

Yadav whose family resides in Umaria district, was arrested on Monday night. "Verma first chopped her hands, legs, neck into seven pieces and stashed these in a sack and placed it on a cycle to dump it near Shahdol-Anuppur railway line, 500m from his house," said additional SP Shahdol, S K Verma told TOI. "After his bicycle got damaged, he then cut the butchered torso into several pieces and dumped it in his backyard," Verma said. It was a blind murder as there were no evidence, but blood stains and broken bangles near Yadav's house helped cracked the case. "He was arrested and interrogated on basis of blood stains and body parts found near his house. During interrogation, he admitted to the crime," said Verma.

Yadav and the slain woman who is yet to be identified developed a relationship as Yadav lived alone and the woman was a widow. She came to Yadav's house and later she allegedly threatened him with rape on Saturday night. An angry Yadav first murdered her with an axe then chopped her body, said police.
