Description:
			A 14-year-old girl student of a government school in Samaipur Badli tried to commit suicide after she was allegedly forced to strip by her teacher on Wednesday.

It is learnt that the victim was in school when a lady teacher accused her of stealing a mobile phone. She was then taken to another room by the teacher who allegedly asked the girl to remove her clothes for a search. The girl returned home and jumped from the terrace of the four-storey building a few hours later.

The victim was rushed to the Baba Saheb Ambedkar Hospital where she is battling for life. A call was made to the police by the hospital authorities.

On Thursday morning, another call was made to the police control room by the victim's father who told the police that his daughter had been beaten up in her school.

Some relatives said the girl was depressed as she felt humiliated at the way she was treated by her teacher. It is also learnt that the girl was weeping when she reached home.

Given the nature of allegations, we are questioning the family members, teachers and other students which would help us in ascertaining whether it is a case of suicide or abetment to suicide, said a senior police official.
