Abuse
Description:
			19 year old victim was brought to Mumbai by her neighbour in Jharkhand, and sold to the Muneer Mukadam for Rs 1000 a year ago. 

Since then, she has stepped out of the house just three or four times, and never on her own despite repeated pleas to the family she worked for. Also, during this time, Muneer a father of three allegedly made at least seven or eight sexual advances towards her, each of which she rebuffed.
