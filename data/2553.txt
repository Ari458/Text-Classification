Rape
Description:
			A 30-year-old man has been sent to jail for 10 years by a fast track court for raping a girl
on the false promise of marrying her nearly a decade ago.

According to the police, Kumar had raped the girl inside a tent shop in Begumpur in October 2003 and when she objected, he threatened her that if she raised an alarm, the boys who were standing outside would come and strip her.
	
It had said Tempo driver Kumar had raped the girl thrice that night and thereafter, pretending to be unmarried, he assured her that he would marry her.
	
Kumar had developed physical relations with her several times after that and when she asked him to marry her, he told her that his parents will not agree as she was from a different religion but he would try to convince them.
	
Had he not promised to marry her, the victim would not have allowed him to have physical intimacy and after she became pregnant, he got her pregnancy terminated.
	 
When the girl came to know that Kumar was already married and he had made physical relations with her on the false promise of marriage, she lodged a case against him.
	
Kumar had sought leniency on the ground that he has to support his family including wife, two kids and parents.
