Murder
Description:
			A 14-year-old girl was strangled to death by her male friend when she allegedly pressurized him to elope with him in Loni area of Ghaziabad.

Police have arrested the accused, identified as Bhura while his friend Irshad, who also helped him commit the crime, is still on the run.

According to police, Bhura apparently was in a relationship with the victim for a long time and both were planning to get married.

"Bhura and the girl were in a relationship. Bhura told police that she called him up yesterday and asked him to meet her. When Bhura met the victim, an argument broke out between them over eloping", Gorakhnath, Station House Officer, Loni police station, said.

"Thereafter, Bhura took the girl to a vacant plot where a fight again broke out over the same issue. When she allegedly continued to pressurise him, he decided to eliminate her," he said.

Police said Bhura also called his friend Irshad and the duo then strangled her to death and fled the spot.

The SHO said that the incident came to light last evening when some passerby spotted the body.

Police have, however, ruled out the possibility of the accused raping the victim before murdering her.

"Victim was not raped before being murdered by the accused. Police have arrested Bhura, who has confessed to killing the girl with the help of his friend Irshad. Police have launched a manhunt to nab Irshad He would soon be arrested," Gorakhnath added.
