Dowry Harassment
Description:
			In a case of callousness, a US-based IT professional Desu Subba Rao (35) has allegedly driven his wife Lakshmi Soujanya, also a software engineer, out of his house over three years ago and has since been avoiding her as she failed to fetch additional dowry.

Soujanya works in an IT firm in Hyderabad. The Bhavanipuram police in the city registered a case against Subba Rao based on a complaint lodged by Soujanya to this effect on March 15.

Soujanya stated in her complaint that her parents Gurram Krishna Rao, a retired doctor, who originally belongs to Guntur but settled in Bhavanipuram in Vijayawada, gave `25 lakh cash and gold worth `5 lakh as dowry to Subba Rao at the time of her marriage with him in August 2010.

Within a month after their marriage, the newly-wed couple went to the US. However, after reaching the US, Subba Rao started harassing Soujanya for additional dowry.  Suspecting her fidelity, he used to confine her in a room in their house and keep it locked all the time. After nine months of stay in US, Subba Rao sent Soujanya back to India. Then on, Soujanya has been living at her parents' house in Vijayawada.

Though Subba Rao used to visit his parents in Tenali, he neither informed his wife about his visit nor called her to stay with him.Soujanya somehow managed to know about one of his visits to Tenali in October last year and went to meet him only to be beaten up and driven away. Vexed with the harassment by her husband and his family members, Soujanya decided to lodge a police complaint.

In her complaint, Soujanya mentioned that Subba Rao, his parents Desu Janardhana Rao and Desu Krishna Kumari, and other family members harassed her for more dowry. Soujanya and her family members also met Vijayawada police commissioner B Srinivasulu recently and sought justice.  Later, the commissioner of police issued directions for seizure of Subba Rao's passport.
