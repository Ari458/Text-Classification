Crime, Rape
Description:
			A city-based man has been arrested for allegedly raping an NRI woman, who claimed that the accused forcefully confined and raped her for several days in April. 

The accused, identified as Siddharth Chakravorty, was arrested from his residence on Turner Road. He is currently unemployed. 

The woman along with her husband -- who works in a private firm -- stays at Qatar. It is learnt that she along with her children came to meet her parents at Roorkee on April 2. 

In her complaint, she alleged that Chakravorty, who was an acquaintance, exploited her on the pretext of providing her a job and took her to several places such as Mussoorie, Vikas Nagar, Kanpur and other cities where she was violated. 

After the victim went missing on April 4, her father lodged a complaint at the Patel Nagar police station. 

However, the complaint was later withdrawn when the woman returned on May 2. 

Nathi Lal Uniyal, SSI, Patel Nagar, said, "The victim along with her children returned to her residence on May 2 and the missing person complaint was withdrawn." 

However, the victim again approached the police on late Wednesday night and lodged a complaint. 

"The victim said Chakravorty also took away her passport, money and jewellery. He also threatened her of dire consequences if she disclosed the incident to anyone," said a police official. 

A case under sections 376 (rape), 342 (wrongful confinement), 406 (criminal breach of trust), 420 (cheating), 506 (criminal intimidation), IPC, has been registered against the accused. 

Uniyal said they were probing the matter.
