Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A 22-year-old man from Nhava Sheva faces arrest after he was booked for allegedly raping a 17-year-old girl from Vasai on the pretext of marriage. The teenager has alleged that the man kept in touch with her for seven months after she delivered a baby boy, but then deserted her.

Suspect Shaniullah Khan had met the complainant at their native place in Uttar Pradesh and both got into a relationship. Throughout her pregnancy, he kept giving her marriage promises. After her delivery, Khan allegedly started telling her that he wanted to settle down first.

However, Khan became incommunicado recently, prompting the minor's family to file a complaint.

Police have registered a case under section 376(Rape) and 420(Cheating) of Indian Penal code.
