Description:
			Angry over his daughter's determination to continue her school education, a man allegedly smashed her face and head with a heavy stone at a village.

The accused, Dinesh Uikey, smashed his 11-year-old daughter Roshni's face when she returned from school in the district's Maramjhiri village and fled.

The girl, a student of class V at a government school at Maramjhiri, was later sent to Betul district hospital where she is undergoing treatment for her injuries and is reported to be out of danger.

The distraught girl told reporters that her father was against her attending the school and used to ill-treat her for continuing with her studies instead of selling wood. She alleged that many a times her father did not serve her food for a whole day.

Police have lodged a complaint against the accused on the basis of the girl's statements under sections 307 (attempt to murder) and 326 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons or means) of IPC.
