Child Sexual Abuse, Murder, Rape
Description:
			Even before the entire nation could forget the horrific incident in Dimapur, Nagaland, in which an alleged rapist was pulled out from police custody and killed by a furious mob, similar incident took place in our very own Andhra town of Eluru. The shocking incident took place in Madepalli in West Godavari district.

Yesterday, a 7 year old innocent girl was brutally raped and killed by an accused named Suresh. Soon after the news broke out, the locals trashed the accused and surrendered him to the police. Earlier this morning, the girl's grieving parents carried out a protest in front of the police station demanding to punish the rapist strictly.

However, Suresh tried to escape from the police custody and jumped off a flyover and injured himself seriously. On seeing the criminal taking the escape route, the angry locals ventured a horrific attack and killed him on the spot. The incident led to intense situation in the surroundings and the police intervened to bring the heat under control.
