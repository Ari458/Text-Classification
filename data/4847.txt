Rape
Description:
			A 28-year-old woman in Bareilly alleged that her husband's elder brother raped her a week ago, when she was alone in her room as her husband was out of town. The wife of the accused too was out of the house at the time. 

The woman said she took her complaint to police when her husband returned, but found that her brother-in-law was in the police station already. 

The police initially refused to register her complaint, she said. 

The woman said that only when she approached ASP Sachin Patel and narrated her ordeal to him was action taken. An FIR was registered on Thursday. 

The crime occurred on May 29. In her complaint, the woman said her brother-in-law came to her room around noon, and abused and beat her, and then raped her. She said he threatened that he would kill her if she reported the incident to someone in the family or police. 

The families of both victim and accused live in the same house in the Math area of the city. The rape survivor's husband works with a transport company in Rudrapur. 

SP (city) Rajeev Malhotra said, "The brothers were in a property dispute. We are investigating the matter." 

An FIR was filed Wednesday under Sections 376 (rape), 452 (house trespass after preparing for assault or wrongful confinement) 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code.
