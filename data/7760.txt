Rape
Description:
			A trial court on Wednesday framed charges against 'Peepli Live' co-director Mahmood Farooqui for allegedly raping an American researcher at his house.

Farooqui pleaded not guilty and claimed trial. The filmmaker, however, failed to get bail from the court, which said it would decide Farooqui's plea only after recording evidence given by the complainant who has been summoned on September 14. The court also said that it would conduct daily proceedings in the case from September 9 to ensure speedy trial.

"On March 28, at your residence in Sukhdev Vihar, you (Farooqui) committed rape of the prosecutrix in the manner defined under Section 375 and punishable under Section 376 of IPC. Let the charge be framed. The application of bail be kept pending," additional sessions judge Sanjiv Jain said. The judge also asked the forensic lab director to expedite the examination of case property and submit the report at the earliest, as the complainant's visa is valid only up to October 5.

This direction came after the investigating officer filed a report on behalf of the forensic science laboratory (FSL) director that the case has been taken up on priority and the forensic results would be ready by September 30. The court directed the FSL to submit its report 10 days earlier on the grounds that the complainant would have to return to the US by October 5. Farooqui also moved an application seeking inspection of the complainant's phone which allegedly had text messages relating to the case, after which the cell phone was sent to the forensic department.

Seeking bail for Farooqui, his counsel had submitted that the accused was a "law abiding citizen" and his family has been cooperative in the probe. However, the prosecution had opposed his bail plea, saying he had committed a heinous crime. Farooqui has been in judicial custody since June 20.
