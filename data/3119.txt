Rape
Description:
			A 60-year-old man was sentenced to 10 years' rigorous imprisonment by a court in Una for repeatedly raping a teenage girl.

District and Sessions judge Rasida M Vora awarded the sentence to Sidique Umar Chauhan, a resident of Hadmadiya village in Kodinar Taluka of Junagadh district. He was also slapped with a fine of Rs 25,000.

The man lured the 18-year-old girl to his flour mill in the village and raped her.

The matter came to light last year when the girl delivered a baby boy following which a complaint was filed at the Una Police station.

The girl's parents are mentally challenged. Police investigated the case and DNA tests conducted on the accused proved the rape allegations following which he was arrested and the trial began.
