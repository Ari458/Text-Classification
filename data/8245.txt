Murder, Rape
Description:
			A minor girl who was set ablaze after being raped in Panna district of Madhya Pradesh died during treatment at a hospital in Rewa on Tuesday.

The 13-year old survivor suffered 70% burns and was in hospital since December 23. She was sexually assaulted on December 22.

She was alone when accused Pappu alias Chawra Lodhi barged into her house and raped her. Subsequently, Lodhi poured kerosene on her and set her ablaze. Her neighbours rushed for help and later told the police who took her to the district hospital where doctors referred her to Sanjay Gandhi Medical College and Hospital, Rewa.

"The accused was arrested the next day. Now he will also be booked for murder," sub-divisional officer of police, Amarnath Verma, told TOI.
Sources said there were two accused and the minor was gang-raped before she was burnt alive. However, police denied this. "As per the complaint and statements of the survivor, there was only one accused, Pappu alias Chawra. We have not received a complaint about other accused," Verma said.
