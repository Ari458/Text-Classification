Description:
			The two girls from Delhi who were gang raped a couple of days ago in Arpora in North Goa by five persons told Anjuna police that they were forced to consume narcotic substances before they were gang raped. 

Police sources said that in their statement before the Anjuna police station, they said that they were forced to consume a white powder in the hotel room. Police said that they are verifying the claims of the victims. 

Police on Friday also recovered all the vehicles used in the crime. Police also recorded the statement of the survivors in front of the judicial magistrate first class at Mapusa under Section 164 of CrPC. 

Police are trying to trace two more accused in the case including a woman who posed as a narcotics control bureau officer. Police are also likely to send a team outside the state to trace the accomplices. 

The five accused who had been arrested in the case had been remanded to seven days police custody. Police arrested Ajay Kusbas, 39, resident of Arpora; Jeevan Pawar, 26, a native of Karwar; Nadeem Khan, 28, a native of Rajashtan; Trebor Joseph, 27, a native of Mumbai and Kamesh Chowdhury, 21, from Hyderabad. 

The two survivors were waylaid and assaulted while travelling in a car at night by five persons posing as cops. All the three including the taxi driver were robbed of cash. The girls were later taken to a hotel and raped. 

The two female tourists had been staying in Goa for the past two weeks at a rented room in Siolim.

The police also learnt that the gang members while detaining the girls in the Calangute hotel room, went to the room in Siolim where the girls were staying and broke open the door to search for money and valuables, but found none. "The motive behind the crime was ransom," said a senior police officer. 

After a medical examination of the survivors, Goa police registered a case of gang rape against five persons.
