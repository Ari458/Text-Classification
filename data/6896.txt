Description:
			A 25-year-old woman who was set on fire by her husband on Thursday had earlier filed a dowry case at Karkardooma Court. 

Rubina had withdrawn the case only after her husband Raees Khan promised to give an alimony of Rs 2,000 per month, but no money was given yet.

Rubina, a resident of Ghaziabad, is still undergoing treatment at Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital. 

She was set on fire by Raees in north-east Delhi Jyoti Nagar. 

In her statement to Shahdara Executive Magistrate Om Prakash, Rubina said she had left home after an argument with Raees on May 7.

Since then she was staying at her father's house in north east Delhi Seemapuri. 
On Thursday, Raees had called Rubina at 1.30 pm, and requested reconciliation. 
Rubina had then informed her father and left home to meet Raees near Loni,the officer added. 

In Jyoti Nagar, Rubina saw Raees standing near an auto-rickshaw and went there. But he poured kerosene on her body and set her afire using matchsticks.
On Saturday, Rubina's family said Raees has been arrested, but not his family members. 

Rubina was tortured by Raess and his family due to which we had also filed a complaint against five of his family members,Rubina's father Pappu told Deccan Herald.

Raees has been arrested, but we want police to arrest his family members as well, he added.

He says Rubina had filed a case of dowry and sought alimony after being tortured. She took the case back due to Raees' false promises,he added.

Rubina and Raees married six years back and have two children. 

On the basis of Rubina's statement, section 498-A (husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty) has also been added to an FIR filed with Jyoti Nagar police station.
