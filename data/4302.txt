Description:
			A Chembur man forcibly shaved the head of his wife and locked her up in a bathroom for four hours after her family could not fulfill his dowry demands, which included a new house and a bike. 

Shafiq Shaikh, 21, and his sister-in-law, Shama, were arrested after the victim, Nisa, who says she's only 18, narrated her ordeal to the RCF police. A local barber, who actually tonsured Nisa while Shafiq and Shama held her down, was also arrested. 

Sharif and Shama have been booked on charges of dowry harassment, subjecting a woman to cruelty, wrongful confinement and assault. The barber faces similar charges except that of dowry harassment. Shafiq works as a driver for a public telecom company. He married Nisa in May last year, and the couple had been living with Shafiq's brother and his wife in a tenement in Chembur's Bharat Nagar locality. 

According to Nisa's complaint, Shafiq had demanded Rs 50,000, a new house and a motorcycle as dowry. He and his family frequently tormented Nisa to pressure her mother, Safiya, who works as a nurse, to fulfill their demands. 

Shafiq and his sister-in-law allegedly beat Nisa up and called local barber Mohammed Karim Shaikh home to shave her head. She was then locked up in the bathroom for four hours. "She gifted Shafiq's family a television, a refrigerator, a washing machine and other household items, but nothing was enough for them," Safiya said. "Look what they have done to my daughter."
