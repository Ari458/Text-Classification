Abuse
Description:
			A man allegedly attacked his wife who was undergoing treatment for severe burns at the Government General Hospital (GGH) here on Sunday. Ramesh of Machavaram, who came to the hospital to see his wife K. Rani, entered into an argument with her and, in a fit of rage, assaulted her, according to her relatives.

Incidentally, Ramesh had been absconding since Rani attempted suicide by setting herself ablaze at G. Konduru recently. Her family had lodged a complaint against him with police.

On Sunday, Ramesh attacked Rani after gaining entry into the ward. After Rani raised the alarm, security personnel and her kin rushed to her rescue, and Ramesh fled.

GGH Superintendent U. Surya Kumari said Ramesh appeared to be in an inebriated state. She said an inquiry had been ordered into the incident. The investigation is on.
