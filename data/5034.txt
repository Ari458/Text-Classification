			A 60-year-old destitute handicap woman was raped twice on Thursday by two youths of the same colony. The community tried to settle the matter but woman was determined to register a case. Police on Saturday detained one of the youths while another fled away.

According to Ramganj police, an old woman, who is handicapped, used to sit near a temple in Sadhu Basti. Two days ago a youth Kanak came on motorcycle and asked her to come with him to the majar in jungle. "He took me in jungle and raped me and afterwards he left me back near the temple," said the complaint.

The victim sat near the temple the whole day and didn't talk to anyone. In the evening another youth Rajendra came and asked her to come for dinner saying his wife had prepared mutton. "He took to me his empty house and raped me and in midnight left me back near the temple," added the complaint.
