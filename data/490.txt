Crime, Dowry Harassment
Description:
			Bicholim police on Wednesday arrested Jagdish Chopdekar on charges of allegedly killing his wife Ujwala, who died due to burn injuries recently at Tikhazan-Mayem. 

On October 13, the victim, Ujwala, 27, committed suicide by setting herself ablaze in the house. Following the incident, the mother and sister of the deceased filed a police complaint against the accused and his family of causing the death of the victim. The complainants also alleged harassment of the victim for dowry and also for giving birth to two girls. The mother and sister of the deceased had sought to take the custody of the Chopdekar's three-year-old and three-month-old daughters. However, the police told mediapersons that the children might be sent to the state protective home at Merces.

"We are likely to send the children to Apna Ghar, from where the family could take possession of the girls," said DySP Bossuet Silva.
