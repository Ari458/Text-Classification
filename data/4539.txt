Description:
			A 41-year-old Army personnel was arrested for raping a sugarcane juice vendor at 101 Maratha Battalion, located opposite the Royal Western India Turf Club, on the Pune-Solapur highway. 

The suspect, havildar Madhukar Ram Dedhe, is posted as a guard at the nursery unit of the battalion. He is a native of Tuljapur in Osmanabad district. 

Assistant police inspector Rahul Goud of Wanowrie police station said that Dedhe had known the 35-year-old married woman, who sold cane juice near the battalion. Around 2.45 pm, Dedhe placed an order for two glasses of juice and asked the woman to deliver it at a tent located inside the battalion. "The woman did as she was told. But Dedhe asked her to wait. He drank one glass of juice and caught the woman by her wrist. Dedhe then forced her to lie on a cot and raped her. He also threatened her not to disclose the matter to anyone," said Goud.

The army authorities handed over Dedhe to the Wanawari police.
