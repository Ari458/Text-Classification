Abduction, Rape
Description:
			Cyberabad police arrested two people on charges of raping a 22-year-old software professional near a forest area on the city outskirts after abducting her in their car.

Satish, a private car-driver and Venkateshwarlu, both aged around 25, were arrested for allegedly raping the young woman.

The techie working in a IT company in the city was on her way to her hostel and was waiting to hire a vehicle near a shopping mall under Madhapur police station limits when the duo approached her and offered to drop her.

Instead of dropping her to the hostel, they took her towards the Kolluru forest area in neighbouring Medak district and committed the crime.

The woman who was staying at a working women's hostel at Gowlidoddi area had joined the software firm recently.

Video footage from a nearby school was obtained which displayed that the car passed on the route that night. However the footage was very blurred. Hence, we took the help of NIA (National Investigation Agency) to identify the make (model) of the car and finally traced this Volvo car in which the duo took the girl.

Satish is working as the car-driver which was taken on lease by a businessman. The duo were booked on charges of kidnapping, gang rape, criminal intimidation, illegal confinement and other relevant charges under IPC.

The duo will be taken into police custody for further interrogation, police had lot of evidence against the two accused.
