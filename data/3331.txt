Description:
			B. Jeevita, 24, wife of TV serial actor B. Prabhakar allegedly committed suicide by hanging at her house in Venkatagiri of Yousufguda.

Prabhakar noticed Jeevita hanging to the ceiling fan with a rope, but without informing the police he removed the rope and shifted her to a corporate hospital in Jubilee Hills. A few minutes later, he called up Jeevitas father Balraj and informed that she ended her life by hanging.

Based on a complaint lodged by Balraj, the police booked a case against Prabhakar under Section 304B of IPC and detained him. He acted in several TV serials, including Bharayamani .

The couples marriage was held on October 10, 2011 and they have a 15-month-old baby girl Karthika. Jeevitas relatives told the police that Prabhakar used to return home in an inebriated condition everyday and harass her demanding additional dowry for producing a TV serial. He relented after Jeevitas parents pacified him promising that they would look into the issue.

He again started torturing Jeevita to get the dowry amount. As it was their marriage day, the couple went to Yadagirigutta and returned home the next day. She later requested him to give money for purchasing a new sari on the eve of Dasara festival, but he allegedly reprimanded her and left the house. He returned home later in the night drunk and started beating her. Unable to cope up with his harassment, she ended her life.
