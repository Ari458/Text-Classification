Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			An Indian woman employee of Sri Lankan Airlines on Wednesday moved the Delhi high court seeking action against the air carrier for alleged non-implementation of the Vishaka guidelines, which deals with cases of sexual harassment at workplaces. 

The petition was mentioned before a vacation bench of justices Siddharth Mridul and Sunita Gupta who agreed to hear the matter on June 20. 

The woman, a sales executive in the airline had filed a complaint of sexual harassment against a senior colleague, a Sri Lankan, which has been pending since 2009 and the airline has not taken any action against him. 

Verma sought directions to the ministries concerned—civil aviation and women and child development—to take action against the company for non-implementation of the guidelines. 

The petition seeks government direction to ensure implementation of the Vishaka guidelines as well as provisions of the sexual harassment at workplace Act in all airlines.
