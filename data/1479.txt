Dowry Harassment, Abuse
Description:
			A Delhi court dismissed the anticipatory bail plea of a Haryana Police constable who has been accused of harassing his spouse over dowry demands.

The accused is working as a constable with Haryana Police since November 2003, and had got married in February 2007.

The prosecution counsel, however, opposed his bail plea saying he and his family members have been demanding a Maruti car and Rs five lakh as dowry since the marriage was solemnised. The prosecutor said Kumar also used to beat up his wife after consuming liquor.
