Description:
			A 15-year-old boy was allegedly set on fire on Friday when he offered stiff resistance to a miscreant trying to outrage the modesty of his mother in Unnao district. The incident took place in Narigada Abdullapur village in Safipur. The boy is undergoing treatment at the district hospital with 60% burn injuries.

The wife of a farmer in Narigada Abdullapur village was being stalked by a local goon and his accomplices for many days.

On Friday, accused Shubham barged into the woman's house and tried to rape her. Her son fought valiantly and forced the goon to beat a hasty retreat.

"Shubham returned later with more than six accomplices and attacked our son, who was alone in the house at that time. He poured kerosene on our boy and set him ablaze," the boy's parents said.

Hearing his cries, the neighbours rushed to the spot, forcing the accused to flee. He sustained 60% burns and was rushed to the district hospital. The villagers also alleged police apathy. They said that the goon and his accomplices were active in the area but no action was taken against them.

The villagers threatened to stage a demonstration at the district headquarters if the police fail to arrest the accused. "On the basis of the complaint lodged by the boy's father, Shubham and other accused have been booked under sections 452/326/354 of the IPC. Raids are on to arrest them," Safipur circle officer Vandana Singh said.
