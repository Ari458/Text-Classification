Molestation, Street Harassment
Description:
			An 18-year-old girl was allegedly molested by three persons, including two teenagers in east Delhi's Trilokpuri area here.

The two juvenile offenders in the case have been apprehended here today, police said, adding that the trio had been stalking the girl earlier as well.

"We have nabbed two offenders and the third accused has been identified but we are withholding his name for the purpose of investigation," said a police official.

Both the victim and the accused are residents of the same Trilokpuri area which had hit headlines after a communal flare up post Diwali last and had caused a major law and order situation.

"The incident took place on Tuesday evening when the girl had gone to the market near block 16 for buying groceries.

When she was walking back to her house from the market, the three youth waylaid her in a deserted lane where they misbehaved with her," the official said.

When the victim objected to their behaviour, the accused even tore her clothes and threatened her not to disclose the matter or they will kill her, said an official quoting the victim's complaint.

The girl went home and reported the matter to her family.

The family members then approached the Mayur Vihar police station on the same evening. Investigation of the case was taken up immediately and a case under sections of molestation was registered.
