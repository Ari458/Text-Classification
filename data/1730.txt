Dowry Harassment
Description:
			According to police, N. Kokila (27) of Palayamkottai, was married to Arun Shanmugam (30) of Kodeeswaran Nagar near Tirunelveli Town, who is now working as a software engineer in Bangalore, a few months ago.

The bride's parents reportedly gave gold jewellery weighing about 1 kg, Rs. 5 lakh in cash, domestic appliances and other utensils as dowry at the time of marriage.

However, the groom and his family members allegedly tortured Ms. Kokila to get a luxury car from her father as dowry. Unable to bear any further, the bride preferred to live with her parents.
