Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			Cases of sexual abuse with children continue to shame the city. A few days back, a labourer working at a multiplex picked up a four-year-old girl from her hut and then raped her when her parents were out for work. Police have arrested the accused and booked him under sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses (POCSO) Act. A medical examination of the girl has also been carried out.

The accused, identified as Dhaneshwar Barman, is a resident of Aasam and currently works as a labourer at an under-construction multiplex near Jaipuria Hospital. He was arrested after the rape survivor's parents lodged an FIR with Bajaj Nagar police station.

"The girl lives in a hut with her parents, who are labourers. They were not home when the incident took place on Thursday," said a police officer.

Barman came to the hut and took the girl to an isolated place on the pretext of giving her chocolates and raped her.

"When the parents came home in the evening, the girl told them about the incident. They went to the nearby hut where Barman lived, but they found him missing. They then came to the police station and lodged an FIR," said the officer.

When the family members saw the accused in the neighbourhood again on Friday, they immediately informed the police following which he was arrested.
