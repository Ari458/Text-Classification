Dowry Harassment, Other
Description:
			A woman has complained to police that her in-laws have installed a CCTV camera at her house to keep a watch on her. She has also accused her in-laws of confining her to a sofa. Meena Rathwani has filed an FIR with the Sardarnagar police, naming her husband Ramesh Rathwani; brother-in-law Girdhan Rathwani; a son from Ramesh's first wife, Mayur Rathwani; and another relative, Harubhai Nanwani. 

The complaint says that Meena and Ramesh were married in March 2006, and this was the third marriage for Ramesh. After some time, the relatives began demanding dowry, and of late had started harassing her to get her out of the house. When a complaint had been filed earlier, cops recorded the statements of the relatives and permitted them to go.
