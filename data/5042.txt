Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A Woman has been sentenced to life for sexually assaulting a minor girl along with her 48-year-old partner who she helped rape the victim for more than a week in Indore, Madhya Pradesh.
Pinky alias Savita and Sunil Karosiya, a history sheeter who later became a property dealer, were also sentenced to 10-year rigorous imprisonment under Section 370 (buying or disposing of any person as a slave) of the IPC on Monday, exactly a year after the FIR in the case was registered in the Aerodrome Police Station, Indore.
The victims parents worked as labourers at Sunil's poultry farm in Hatod area. He took the minor to his flat in Rajkamal Residency telling her parents that she would do odd jobs there and he would pay her Rs 500 per month. While Sunil lived in Kalani Nagar, Pinky lived in a flat which he frequented.
Additional government pleader Ravindra Desai told The Indian Express that Pinky used to abuse the minor and also prompt Sunil in raping the victim. He would tell her parents that she was safe and happy and was not keen on living with them.
When neighbours realised that the duo had locked up the minor and were exploiting her they informed an NGO which in turn got in touch with the police and rescued the girl. The minor told the police that Pinky used to beat her up if she resisted Sunil.
The duo had been booked under Sections 376 (2), 370 and 320 of the IPC.
