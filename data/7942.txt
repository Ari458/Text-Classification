Description:
			Some youths threw acid on two women in Hargovind Nagar Colony of Kurukshetra on Thursday night. The incident took place when the victims were taking a walk in a nearby street after having dinner. Both victims are under treatment in two private hospitals. The victims have been identified as Sarita, 35, and Kanchan, 50. Both are neighbours and were walking near Salarpur road after dinner when they were attacked. Kanchan's condition is serious as she received acid burns on neck, face, chest and shoulder. Her husband Ramesh Arora is a property dealer.

"Both women have no clue about the culprits as they are not in a position to say anything about the attack. We are investigating the case from different angles after registering an FIR in the matter," said Kurukshetra Sadar SHO Ram Kumar.

"We were on walk when suddenly three youths on motorcycle stopped near us. We did not pay much attention to them. Initially, we felt that they threw some liquid on us. We had no idea about what was it. After few minutes on our way to home we felt burning sensation. When it was unbearable, we asked our family members to take us to the hospital," the victims told the police.
