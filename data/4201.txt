Description:
			A farmer and his second wife have been arrested for stripping and severely beating up his first wife in Girnare village of Nashik tehsil. The injured woman has been admitted to Nashik General (Civil) Hospital.

Shivaji Gaikar (60) of Girnare village and his second wife Seeta (40) were arrested for allegedly attempting to kill Ranjana (55). Ranjana has a son and wanted Shivaji's farm to be distributed equally. She has also filed a case in court.

Shivaji and Seeta tied Ranjana to an electricity pole behind Vithal Mandir, tore her clothes, and severely smashed her with stones. To stop her from asking for a share in the farm, Seeta hit Ranjana on her mouth with a stone.
Hearing her screams, villagers arrived and stopped the duo from killing her. Seeing the angry villagers, the two fled. Village women then clothed Ranjana and took her to the hospital, while someone called the police.
As she cannot speak due to her injuries, her brother Arjun Thete filed a complaint with the taluka police station.

She cannot speak due to her injuries, but police have arrested the two accused. They conducted their medical test and they will be produced in court.
