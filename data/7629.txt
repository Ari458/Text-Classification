Domestic Violence, Murder
Description:
			A married woman was found dead at her in-laws place at Shivani in Tarikere taluk on Wednesday. Her father, suspecting it to be a murder, has filed a complaint against her husband and in-laws. The Ajjampura police gave name of the deceased as Shyla (35), wife of Parameshwarappa. Shyla, native of Hosadurga in Chitradurga district, was married to Parameshwarappa 15 years ago. The couple had two sons.

In his complaint Chandrappa, Shyla's father, said that she was harassed by her husband and in-laws frequently. He too had visited Shivani many times and tried to resolve the differences. On Wednesday, I received a call that my daughter died of heart attack. When I reached Shivani, her body was kept outside. Her neck and head were covered by a cloth. I removed the cloth and noticed a mark in her neck. She did not die of heart attack. She must have been hanged, he said.

He has filed complaint against her husband Parameshwarappa, mother-in-law Kariyamma and sister-in-law Gowramma. Ajjampura police have taken her husband for inquiry.
