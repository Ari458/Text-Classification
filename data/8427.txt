Rape
Description:
			A 30-year-old deaf and mute woman was allegedly sexually assaulted by a 22-year-old man inside a private bus at Pushp Vihar in south Delhi on Monday night. The woman was on her way back after getting food from a shop. She went inside the bus to shelter herself from cold and planned to have her dinner there.

The accused, Dheeraj Bhardwaj, who runs a salon in the area, was arrested after the woman filed a complaint with the help of a translator. A rape case has been registered against him.

Dheeraj was on a bike with two of his friends and saw the woman getting inside the bus. He tried to force herself on her, while his associates guarded the vehicle. However, a child playing nearby heard her cry and immediately informed the policemen patrolling the area.

Police said the woman sustained minor bruises. "The policemen identified the accused while they were fleeing. They also identified the trio's bike," an official said. Police are now trying to trace Dheeraj's associates.
