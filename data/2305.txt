Rape
Description:
			A man was today awarded ten years rigorous imprisonment by a local court for raping a girl student of Haryana's only all-women university.

Additional District and Sessions Judge, Sonipat, Manisha Batra handed down the sentence to Amit alias Mita, a resident of Khanpur Kalan village in Sonipat district.

In case of non-payment of the fine, the convict's imprisonment term would increase for another two years.

The court, however, acquitted three others who were also accused of raping the student, who studied in the first year at Bhagat Phool Singh University.

She had registered a complaint with Gohana Police on May 18 last year alleging that after getting permission she went outside the university gate for purchasing books when Amit and two others arrived in a car and forcibly dragged her into the vehicle.

They took her to a nearby field and committed the crime.

Later, they dumped her near the university's gate.
