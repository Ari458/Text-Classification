Dowry Harassment
Description:
			The death of a woman within six months of her wedding was reported from Kovilpatti in Tuticorin district.

The deceased is Vijayalakshmi, a nurse. She was the daughter of Sundar Raj, a resident of Pillayarnatham. Vijayalakshmi was married off to Ramesh, a resident of Villiseri, near Kovilpatti.

A dowry of 15 sovereigns and households things was given at the time of the marriage. After Ramesh went abroad soon after the marriage, Ramesh's mother Sinna Ramalakshmi had been demanding 50 sovereigns from Vijayalakshmi. She told her parents that her in-laws were harassing her. Only 10 days back, Vijayalakshmi had come to her father's house alleging that her mother-in-law had hit her while insisting on dowry. Her parents had contacted her husband, but he too is reported to have spoken in favour of his parents.

Vijayalakshmi resorted to the extreme step by consuming poison. She was rushed to the Kovilpatti hospital in an unconscious state where she succumbed.

An RDO inquiry has been ordered into the death as the girl died within a year of her marriage.
