Description:
			On October 11, she was on her way to the bank to deposit a cheque worth Rs 1.65 lakh, which had been signed by her uncle.

Seizing the opportunity, Khanulkar approached her to apologise for harassing her earlier, and soon started walking with her.Suddenly an auto rickshaw pulled up in front of them. Khanulkar's friend Kalpesh Vinod Parmar (26) pulled the girl in and drove away.

After kidnapping her, they took the girl to Gokul Hotel  on the highway at Dahisar. While Parmar stood guard, Khanulkar raped the girl, threatening to kill her uncle and grandmother if she protested. 

The men appropriated the cheque she was carrying, withdrew Rs 1.65 lakh from the bank, and used it to pay for the hotel stay. They then took her to various hotels in Shirdi, Konkan, Pune and Goa, raping her at each pit stop. They also sold the girl's gold chain for Rs 18,000 to pay for the rest of the bills.
