Molestation
Description:
			The wife of the baba (godman), who was arrested for allegedly sexually assaulting a Thane-based woman on the pretext of blessing her with a child, has now accused the victim's husband of molestation.

A case was also registered with the Kandeshwar police on the same day the couple lodged a complaint.

The police claims that the accused, Yogesh Kupekar's wife registered the case only to take revenge against them.

After Kupekar had sexually assaulted the Thane woman, her husband had contacted the accused and told him that he would lodge a police complaint against him.

"We suspect that Kupekar must have got scared with the threat and so he made his wife lodge a complaint of molestation against the victim's husband", a police official said.

Meanwhile, Kupekar was granted judicial custody on Friday. The 42-year-old accused has been charged for sexually assaulting the 29-year-old woman, who was unable to conceive a child.

Kupekar claimed to have 'divine powers' that would help childless women conceive. He would make couples have sex in his presence, while he would chant mantras to bless them with children. He used to operate from Goregaon but resided in Panvel.
