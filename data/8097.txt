Dowry Harassment
Description:
			A 24-year-old MBBS graduate committed suicide at her house in Medipally on Monday night due to alleged dowry harassment. 

"Bhavani locked herself up in the bedroom at 8 pm on Monday and hanged herself from the ceiling fan with a stole. There was no suicide note. The incident came to light around 9 pm when the family members sensed that something was wrong as Bhavani did not open the door even after knocking. They broke the door latch only to find her hanging," Medipally police inspector B Naveen Reddy said. 

Bhavani, a native of Warangal and resident of P&T Colony at Medipally, had married another MBBS graduate, D Prithviraj, currently working at a private hospital in Begumpet, two-and-half years ago. The couple has a four-month-old son. 

On Tuesday, the victim's parents lodged a complaint with the police alleging that Bhavani had committed suicide due to harassment for additional dowry by her husband and in-laws. 

"We have registered a dowry death case under Section 304-B of the IPC against Prithviraj, his parents and two sisters. Nobody has been arrested yet," inspector Naveen Reddy added.
