Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			In yet another case of child abuse, a tuition teacher, who allegedly raped his 12-year-old student several times, was arrested by the police.

Alex P (52) of Ooramana, near Ramamangalam, is a catechism teacher at a church in the area. The accused befriended the Class VII victim's parents at church and volunteered to take Malayalam tuition classes for their daughter at his residence whenever he was free.

The victim said that she was raped by the accused several times for five to six months in 2013. After Alex repeatedly abused her, the minor stopped the tuition classes in February 2014. The accused stayed in her neighbourhood and whenever his wife was not at home, he would call the minor home on the pretext of teaching her. The incident came to light recently when she told her friend about the abuse, who then informed her family.

Police heard about the incident and sent women police officials to take the victim's statement. She confirmed the incident and they registered a case against the accused.

The victim had not informed her parents about the abuse. Police is now trying to verify if the accused had threatened her or whether she kept mum due to fear.

Alex was arrested by the police team from Choondi near Aluva. Alex was planning to apply for an anticipatory bail, according to police.

The girl was raped by Alex when his wife was not in the house.

The investigation is in the preliminary stage and police can't say whether he has molested or raped others. But they will certainly look into whether any student, who attended his catechism classes, were subjected to sexual harassment.
