Description:
			A 15-year-old rag picker was allegedly gang-raped, murdered and dumped in the city's Focal Point area.

A postmortem report revealed that the minor girl's neck bore marks of strangulation, and her body carries blood spots indicating that she had been raped several times before and after her death, a police officer said.

According to police, the girl lived in a slum area in Dhandari.

The girl's father claimed that on Monday she had left home as usual to collect rags.

As she did not return home by evening, they started a search. On Tuesday afternoon, they were told that her body had been lying in a vacant plot in the city's Focal Point area.
