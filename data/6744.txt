Description:
			A 40-year-old has been arrested for allegedly sodomising his friend's 10-year-old son and trying to murder him in southwest Delhi's Raj Nagar area. The accused, identified as Satish was arrested from his home after the victim's family lodged a complaint.

"The incident took place last evening when the accused, who is known to the victim's father, took the child with him on the pretext of fishing in Ghumenhera. At a secluded place, the accused sodomised the boy threatening him of dire consequences," said a senior police official.
