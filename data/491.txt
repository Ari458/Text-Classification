Abduction, Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A dalit girl has accused Bahujan Samaj Party legislator from Shahjahanpur, Neeraj Maurya of abducting and raping her and also claimed that she had a 10-month child from the legislator.

The girl, Sakshi Soni, a resident of Mauzampur village in the district, has levelled the allegations in an affidavit  filed in the court of Judicial Magistrate Parul Pawar, according to reports.

She has alleged that Maurya's goons had abducted her from a field near her village about 18 months back and took her to the legislator's house at Jalalabad in the district, where she was raped by Maurya and some others.

The family of the girl had lodged a report with the police when she was abducted and suspected the role of the MLA but the police, instead of booking the MLA, arrested some one else and also filed a charge sheet against him in the court. 

The dalit girl alleged that she was released by her abductors in December last. 
We had approached the police on many occasions seeking to register a case against the MLA and his goons but our pleas fell on deaf ears, Harsahai Soni, her father, said.
