Rape
Description:
			A young woman in Punjab's Moga district has alleged that she was gang-raped by her friend's husband and his friends, police said Friday.
The allegation came hours after the horror story of a girl being killed after being pushed out of a moving bus by her molesters in the same town.

The victim, aged 23, said she was gang-raped by her friend's husband and others on the night of April 29 at a secluded house in Marhi Mustafa village near Moga, 180 km.from here.
Police have registered a case of rape against her friend's husband and others following the complaint. No arrest has been made so far.
One report said police named the woman victim several times at a press briefing and also accused her of lying.
The victim claimed she had gone, along with her boyfriend, to meet her friend at the latter's house on Wednesday night. They decided to stay there overnight.
The friend's husband came home drunk late in the night with seven other friends. They allegedly thrashed her boyfriend and took her to the tube-well room in a secluded part of the village.
She was gang-raped by the eight men after confining her to the room and allowed to leave the room only on Thursday morning.
