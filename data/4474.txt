Description:
			A 50-year-old widow, who was allegedly gang-raped by the head of a religious place and his associate over eight months ago, has delivered a baby girl at a hospital here, police said.

The woman delivered the baby last evening when she was taken to hospital by police for medical examination.

The woman, a resident of Bal Purian village here, became pregnant after she was repeatedly raped by Kulwant Singh Magga, the head of a religious place where she was living, and his aide Janju Pehlwan, police said.

One of her relative, in a police complaint, claimed that she was living at the religious place at Bal Purian after her husband died around 10 years ago.

When she got pregnant, the accused allegedly tried to abort her pregnancy, with the help of a female servant, Bholi, but police intervened and rescued the women.

Batala police station SHO Amolak Singh said a case under various IPC sections pertaining to rape had been registered against Magga, Pehlwan and Bholi, who are absconding.
