Description:
			A carpool driver was arrested on Saturday for allegedly harassing an 11-year-old girl who studies in a well known central Kolkata school. 

The accused, Sanjay Gupta, used to fill in when the regular driver was on leave. This was when he started harassing the girl and continued doing so till a few days ago when she finally informed her parents. 

"He was apparently introduced by the full-time driver about 20 days ago. A couple of weeks ago, Gupta asked the girl to write down her mobile number on a piece of paper and hand it over to him. When she refused, he got furious and scribbled his name on her arm with a pen. He continued to bother the girl till the full-time driver returned," said a police officer. 

The complaint, filed by the girl's mother, says Gupta continued to stalk the child even when he wasn't driving the carpool. "On Tuesday, he even stopped her car and tried to talk to her. This was when the girl felt she had to fight back and informed her parents," the officer said. 

Gupta has been charged under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act under sections that could lead to five years in jail in case he is convicted. Gupta has apparently told investigators that he had no intention to molest or sexually assault the girl. 

"He said he treated her as a child and was just having fun at her discomfiture. The other children didn't mind when he got friendly with them, he said. But we will talk to the parents of other kids who shared the carpool," the officer added.
