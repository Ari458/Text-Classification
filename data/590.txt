Abuse
Description:
			Balram was a habitual drunkard and this often led to verbal tiffs between the couple. During their quarrels, Balram would often abuse and physically assault Amreen, the police said. On Thursday night, a similar situation arose when Balram returned home in an inebriated condition and picked up an altercation with Amreen. He allegedly thrashed Amreen with a wooden plank.

The police said that enraged by her husband's behaviour, Amreen picked up a burning log of wood from the 'chulah' (fireplace) and set herself ablaze. Balram tried to put off the flames, but he, too, sustained burn injuries, the police added.
