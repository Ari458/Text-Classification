Crime, Rape
Description:
			The crime branch has charged an Indian Reserve Batallion (IRB) police constable with rape and cheating. Pritam Lavu Kadam had 'married' a woman from Sawantwadi, Maharashtra, in 2014, while he was already married and had a child.

The case was first registered in March at the Saligao police station under Section 494 (bigamy) and other sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Then, last week, the case was transferred to crime branch. Karthik Kashyap, SP, Crime Branch, said on Tuesday that after the case was transferred, IPC sections concerning rape and cheating were added to the original FIR.

According to police sources, the constable was on patrolling duty at Calangute when he got friendly with a woman who had a garment shop at Calangute. Later, as their friendship grew, he fell in love with her. He proposed marriage to her and, while on duty, sporadically stayed with her and her mother at their rented house at Calangute.

Then, when the woman's family insisted that the two get married and wanted his family, the constable never introduced his family to the woman's family. Police sources said that the woman's family is very poor.

On January 12, 2014, the two got 'married' at Sawantwadi. He hadn't informed her that he is already married and had a child. After some time, the woman came to know that her 'husband' was already married and a father.

The woman then immediately filed a first information report (FIR) at Saligao police station, which recorded the statement of the accused.
