Child Sexual Abuse, Murder, Rape
Description:
			A father raped and killed his 15-year-old daughter in Anthampally village of Bhiknoor mandal (Andhra Pradesh) in the early hours of Thursday.

According to the police, after raping his daughter in an inebriated condition, Jeedi Bhupal, 44, poured toilet cleaner and kerosene over the girl and set her on fire, trying to pass it off as an acid attack. 

The police suspected Bhupal as he gave conflicting versions of the incident. After being taken into custody, he confessed to the crime on Thursday evening.

Bhupal's contradictory statements, however, made the police suspicious, and during questioning he confessed that he had raped his daughter in an inebriated condition on Wednesday night. To divert attention from himself, he had poured toilet cleaner and kerosene on Kalyani and set her on fire. 

He said that his family members, including his wife, knew of the attack. But he had threatened to kill them if they told anyone. While the attack took place between midnight and 2 am of Thursday, the girl was shifted to the hospital only by about 4 am.
