Murder, Rape
Description:
			A man was awarded life imprisonment by a local court for raping and murdering a middle-age woman four months ago.

Additional Sessions Judge of West Siang district of Arunachal Pradesh Jawplu Chai also slapped a fine of Rs 5000 on the man, who hails from Assam's Lakhimpur district, in default of which he would undergo a simple imprisonment of another year.

Both the sentences would run consecutively, the judge said in his order on Wednesday.

The court also considered the matter of compensation to the woman's husband and children but as the convict was unable to even afford his own defence counsel, the matter would be referred to the District Legal Service Authority for deciding the matter under Arunachal Pradesh Victim Compensation Scheme, 2011.

Bohuna Das had raped and murdered the woman at Garu in West Siang district on August 29, this year and an FIR in connection with it was lodged at Likabali police station the next day.
