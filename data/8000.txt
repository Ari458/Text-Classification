Abuse
Description:
			A 34-year-old woman filed a case against four people on Wednesday for allegedly threatening to rape her because she overtook their car. Bhavika Dharod, the victim, was at the basement parking of Dreams Mall, Bhandup, at around 4 pm on Wednesday when the reported harassment took place. 

Dharod had been entering the parking lot when an Innova behind her began honking. "There were four people in the SUV and one of them stepped out and abused me, asking how I had dared overtake them," she told Mirror. "The SUV followed me and kept honking. Suddenly, their car came in front of mine, and one of them got out to come to my side. I could not believe my ears when the man said he would rape me, he kept saying it as I shut the window. Another man came to the other side of the car and started hitting the windscreen and tried to open the car. The men drove off after I started yelling for help and a parking assistant walked by." The parking assistant told Dharod that the car belonged to a Shiv Sena union leader named Satish Mane whose office was in the mall. "I parked my car at the entrance of the parking lot so that they couldn't flee and asked the guard to get help. I also called my husband who called the police. Cops reached the spot in 15 minutes and some women gathered to help me. The policemen found the Innova but the men were missing". 

Dharod was taken to the Bhandup police station where cops told her they could not register an FIR since the incident amounted to a non cognisable offence. After an argument lasting two hours, they finally registered an FIR against the accused under sections 504, 506 and 509 of the IPC for intent to provoke breach of peace, criminal intimidation and insulting the modesty of woman. "We arrested the four accused on Friday and produced them in court, which released them on bail" said senior police inspector Shripad Kale from Bhandup police station.
