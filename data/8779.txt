Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A seven-year-old girl was allegedly raped by a 16-year-old boy at Gamharpur village under Kahalgaon police station in Bhagalpur district on November 24. The incident came to light on Sunday when the girl's family lodged an FIR with the Kahalgaon police station against the boy, his parents and grandfather.

According to the complaint, the accused boy's parents and grandfather threatened the girl's family with dire consequences if they reported the matter to the police.

Police said the incident occurred when the minor girl was playing outside her house in absence of her parents. "The boy dragged the girl inside her house and outraged her modesty. Her mother, who reached home at the same time, raised an alarm. The boy, however, managed to escape," police said, adding that the girl's family avoided reporting the incident to the police fearing social stigma. "They finally lodged an FIR three days after the incident," said police. The girl's father works in Delhi.

The police on Sunday got the minor girl examined at a government hospital here. Sources said doctors have confirmed injuries in the private parts of the girl.

Kahalgaon DSP Ramanad Kumar Kaushal said a manhunt had been launched to arrest the boy and other accused family members. "If the accused boy is found to be a minor, he would be sent to reform home and tried under the Juvenile Justice Act," the DSP added.
