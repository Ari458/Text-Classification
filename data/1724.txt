Abduction, Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			Chatrapati Munda had thrown his young victim into a 20-feet-deep well after raping her. He had abducted her while she was on her way to school on the morning of October 10, 2006.

Prosecution lawyer Om Prakash Gaurav said an FIR was registered on the basis of the victim's statement on October 11, 2006 and during trial as many as seven persons turned up as prosecution witnesses, but no one came forward to defend the accused.

After abducting the minor, a Class VII student of a government school, Munda took her to a friends place in Korwa where he raped her several times. He then threw her into a well, from where she was rescued by a villager and handed over to her farmer parents, Gaurav said.

He said an FIR was registered the next day, and a medical examination the day after at Sadar Hospital confirmed rape. He added that the girl did not drown as there was little water in the well and a villager who had come to draw water heard the girl's cries for help.
