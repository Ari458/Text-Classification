Molestation, Crime
Description:
			Police insensitivity towards women victims of crime came to the fore yet again, when Noida Police refused to register a molestation case in an incident that took place on Sunday, finally admitting an FIR in the complaint on Monday.

Around 9.30 am on Sunday, the 20-year-old said she had hauled an autorickshaw from east Delhi's Trilokpuri on her way to office. Near the Delhi border, the driver took an unfamiliar turn. When she asked why he had done so, he said it was a short cut.

"Near the Chilla regulator, the driver started misbehaving with me. When I resisted, he strangled my neck with his arms. I was about to lose consciousness, when two passersby on a motorbike rushed in to help, at which the accused pushed me into the high drain from a height, and fled with my mobile phone and handbag. The bikers managed to take down a part of the auto's registration number ," she said.

"The motorists called my sister, who called the emergency number 100, but the attendant said police could help only if I provided the auto's registration number. This despite us giving half the registration number and a description of the driver, around 28 years old, who wore a red T-shirt, grey trousers and had large eyes."

The victim's nightmare, though, had just begun. When she approached the Sector 14-15 police post around 10 am to lodge her complaint, the concerned police post in-charge told her he was on leave and couldn't lodge the FIR.

By Monday, though, the matter had come to the notice of GB Nagar SSP Preetinder Singh, at whose order an FIR was registered at the Sector 20 PS at 5.30 pm and a manhunt launched. "We have lodged an FIR under appropriate sections. We're using technical and human intelligence to pursue the culprit," said Vijay Dhull, additional superintendent of police, GB Nagar.
