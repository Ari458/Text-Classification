Rape
Description:
			The Delhi High Court has upheld seven-year jail term awarded by a trial court to a man for raping a mentally challenged woman, who was his neighbour.
	
Dismissing the appeal of Surender Krishan Seth against the conviction order, Justice S P Garg upheld the trial court verdict against him.
	
Relying on the testimony of the victim's mother, the court rejected Seth's claim that he was falsely implicated by the lady as she wanted to grab his plot of land.
	
A mother is not expected to tender false evidence against an innocent in her attempt to grab the plot and spoil the reputation of her unmarried young daughter.
	
Seth, a resident from Narela, has challenged the trial court's December 20, 2010 order in which he was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment for raping the 30-year-old mentally challenged woman.
	
According to the prosecution, on August 8, 2007, Seth had dragged the victim to his house and raped her. The victim later apprised her mother about the incident, who then lodged a police complaint.
	
The court also accepted the medical report which said that the victim was sexually assaulted.
