Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			Borivli police inspector, accused of stalking and passing lewd messages to a rape victim and caused major embarrassment for the entire force, was suspended on Saturday. 

TOI had reported the plight of the rape victim in its May 22 edition `Cop probing rape complaint stalked her, woman tells police'. Inspector Anil Avadh who was the investigating the rape case allegedly visited her place under pretext of carrying out investigation and passed lewd message on her T shirt and her appearance. The woman got furious as earlier too he had during carrying out panchnama passed comments on rape survivor's undergarments. 

"I immediately wrote a letter to Mumbai police commissioner Rakesh Maria complaining the same. It was a very embarrassing and humiliating situation when inspector Avadh commented on the size of my underwear. Later I discovered that a woman officer should have been assigned for this work and why Avadh was conducting the panchnama.''said victim. 

Avadh had rubbished this allegations and told TOI that he was likely to file a defamation case against the victim. 

"According to the Supreme Court's guidelines, a lady police officer should have been investigating my complaint of rape and cheating. Further, I was made to sit in the police station on two consecutive days and the FIR was registered only on the second day at 12.30am despite the guidelines clearly stating that women should not be detained in a police station after dusk," the woman told TOI. 

Senior officials said that fresh allegation on the investigating officer Avadh had come as a major embarrassment for the beleaguered force at the time when the force at a time when cops from all over were facing serious charges ranging from kidnapping, molestation, extortion and drug trafficking.
