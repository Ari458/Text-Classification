Crime, Rape
Description:
			Following a complaint lodged by a 40-year-old woman, Ponda police have booked Kishor Kawlekar, 43, from Banastarim in Ponda taluka, for allegedly sexually abusing her since 2012.

Kawlekar was admitted to Hospicio Hospital, Margao, after he complained of giddiness on receiving news of his detention on Sunday.

Police said that the woman, a mother of a six-month-old baby, filed a complaint stating that the accused had raped her two years ago by luring her with an offer that he would make available to her the state government run Griha Aadhar Scheme.

The survivor claimed that Kawlekar has been intimidating and blackmailing her on several other occasions for the past two years.

"The woman has attributed the reason for her silence about the incident to intimidation and blackmailing. She has complained that the accused had photographed her in a compromising position with him on his mobile phone, and used this picture to threaten her that he would show the picture to her husband, if she refused to entertain him again," Ponda police said.

On Friday, the accused pelted stones at her house and abused her infront of the whole neighbourhood, making the matter clear to her family. This incident promted the survivor to speak up and file a complaint, police added.

Police have booked the accused under Sections 376, 354-C, 406, 506-II, 504, 427 of the IPC, but as the accused fell ill on detention, he has not been formally arrested. Ponda PSI Suraj Gawas is investigating the case.
