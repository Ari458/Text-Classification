Rape
Description:
			A 35-year-old woman was allegedly gangraped on by her brother-in-law and a neighbour, a few days after the death of her husband at Sadarpur in Noida. 

DSP Brijesh Singh said the victim had lodged a complaint with the police that her brother-in-law Parmanand and neighbour Gaurav raped her at her residence. Her sister was also present in the house and the accused had locked her up in another room.
The victim had been asked by Harsh's family to vacate the residence soon after his death, the sources said. Having refused to do so, she urged her sister to stay with her, they said. This had further worsened the situation and the victim's relations with the rest of the family deteriorated, the sources said.
