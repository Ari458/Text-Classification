Foeticide/Infanticide
Description:
			People were astonished to observe the 24 dead foetuses lying on the roadside. 10 foetuses were found near Arekere School and 14 were found near garbage located by the side of Theerthahalli road here. They were packed in a box and dumped in the garbage.

Though there have been stringent law to vanish foeticide, mounting number of such incidents have been reported and greed for money by the staffs at the hospitals are considered the cause for such cases, allege local people.
