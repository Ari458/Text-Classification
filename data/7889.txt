Description:
			A Class X student from a Malda village was allegedly gang raped near her house last night when she stepped out to relieve herself.

Two youths have been arrested.

Police said when the 16-year-old girl walked out of the house last night, three youths waylaid her. "The youths, who had been reportedly teasing the girl for some time, pounced on her. After gagging her, they took her to a mango orchard about 50m away. There they allegedly took turns to rape her. They fled after the girl lost consciousness," a source said.

The girl's father, a farmer, said the family was asleep when the girl went out. The girl returned around 2am and narrated the incident. Soon after, the family lodged a police complaint naming the three.

Malda police superintendent Prasun Banerjee said: "The arrested youths are daily labourers. The third person is a Class XI student. He has run away. The duo have been charged with gang rape."
