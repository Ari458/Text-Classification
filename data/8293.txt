Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			The District Mahila Court Judge G. Raja on Tuesday sentenced a 58-year-old man to undergo five years of imprisonment for sexually abusing his 14-year-old daughter.

S. Baghyanathan (58) of Uppumundy at Kempatty Colony had sexually abused his daughter for more than a year. The girl, who discontinued Class 10, was working in a gold smithy close to her house.

In her complaint, the girl had said that her father made her drink milk laced with sedatives before raping her in May 2013. When she told this to her mother, she was allegedly beaten up for making false accusation.

Later, the girl told her employer’s wife about her father. With the help of the employer and his wife, she lodged a complaint with the All Woman Police (West) on September 10, 2013.

Baghyanathan was booked under section 3(a) and 4 of The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act. He was arrested and later granted bail.

It is learnt that during the trial the girl’s mother and elder sister turned hostile. The case was proved with substantial medical records.

On completion of the trial, Mahila Court Judge Raja on Tuesday convicted the man and imposed a fine of Rs. 5,000 on him. On failing to pay the amount, the imprisonment will be extended by six more months.
