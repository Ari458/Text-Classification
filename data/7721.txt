Street Harassment
Description:
			A Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation contract labourer has been arrested for harassing a Plus Two girl student.

Police said P. Manikandan (25) of Mettu Piraancherry near Gangaikondaan, who is working as a contract labourer with the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation, was harassing a Plus Two student from the same area for the past several months. However, the girl ignored Manikandan.

When he tried to speak to the girl when she was going to the school on Wednesday, she warned that she would tell her parents about the problems being created by him. Agitated over this, Manikandan issued death threat to the girl, saying that he would kill her if she dared to complain about him to her parents.

After the girl informed her parents about the harassment, they submitted a complaint with the Tirunelveli Taluk All Women Police on Wednesday evening and he was subsequently arrested.
