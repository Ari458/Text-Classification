Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			An FIR was lodged against a 22-year-old man on Sunday for allegedly raping his neighbour, a minor. The survivor, a 14-year-old class VI student told police that the accused, Manoj alias Monu had repeatedly raped her over the last two months.

Police said, Monu, worked as a welder at a garage in Surat Nagar and is reportedly absconding.

According to the police, the survivor lived with her mother who worked as a housemaid in several houses. Her mother told police that after she would leave for work; her daughter would stay alone at home. This was the time when Monu would come to their house and molest her. Monu reportedly also threatened to kill the survivor if she spoke about the incident to anyone.

When the girl obeyed, Monu felt encouraged to carry on with his act. Two months back, the accused took her to a nearby house and raped her. She alleged that Monu raped her repeatedly after that for over two months. She confided in her mother when she could no longer bear it. Her mother then reported the matter to the police.

A medical examination confirmed that the girl was raped. A case was filed under section 4 of the POCSO act. Preliminary investigation shows that the accused, a native of Bahadurgarh, is history-sheeter who has been earlier caught for several cases of theft.

"The accused is on the run. We are conducting raids to nab him and he will be arrested soon," said sub inspector Rani Devi, the investigating officer.
