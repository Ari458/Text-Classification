Abuse
Description:
			A youth allegedly tried to sexually assault a girl in public after her pet cat reportedly ate his pigeon. The attempted assault occurred after the man chased the girl in public and tried to assault her at her home when her family members were absent.

Talking to TOI, inspector, Cantonment police station, Surya Nath Yadav, said, "We have lodged a complaint against the youth under Section 323 (Punishment for voluntarily causing hurt) and 354 (Assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty). He has been arrested and sent to jail."

As per reports, 19-year-old Neha (name changed), a resident of village Mohanpur Thiriya, has a pet cat in her house. Her neighbour, Rakesh, 22, is fond of domesticating pigeons.

On Friday afternoon, the cat entered the Rakesh's house, where it reportedly caught a pigeon and ate it.

Seeing this, Rakesh, who arrived lost his temper and after chasing away the animal, rushed towards the girl's house. Sensing danger, Neha, who was alone at that time, tried to flee but the accused reportedly grabbed her and tried to sexually assault her. The accused chased her to the road and tried to grab her once again.

In the meantime, girl's parents and neighbors, upon hearing the commotion, reached the spot and caught hold of the man and thrashed him. He was later handed over to police, which registered a case against him and sent him to jail.
