Murder
Description:
			The body of an unidentified woman, possibly from the northeast or Tibetan origin, was found dumped near Subhash Park in central Delhi's Daryaganj in the early hours of Friday. Her legs were tied with a piece of cloth and she was stuffed inside a sack containing vegetables with Tiptur Copra written on it. The injury marks on her body suggest that she was thrown out of a moving car.

A murder case has been registered and the possibility of sexual abuse has not been ruled out. Police also suspect human trafficking.
The woman's body was found by vagabonds near the Netaji Subhash Road-Ansari Road crossing. The fair complexioned woman, aged about 25 years, was wearing a T-shirt with "Be strong" written on it, a pair of black leggings and sky blue socks with yellow and blue stripes. She was also wearing three rings with precious stones on her right hand and a pair of gold earrings. A pink dupatta was around her neck and it appears that she was strangled with it.
Initial probe suggests that the woman had died a day ago. The body has been sent to JPN hospital for autopsy to confirm sexual assault. The clothes have been sent for forensic analysis. Cops are scanning missing complaints registered in the past 48 hours.

Since Friday morning, police have received three requests for identification. Teams have been sent to Dimapur in Nagaland and Darjeeling after two people claimed that the woman was a family member. CCTV footages from the area are being scanned for leads.
