Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			Girls of a government boarding school in Kushinagar have accused two grade IV employees of the school of raping them. The school, which has 300 girl students, is run by the district social welfare office. 

Nisha (name changed), a student of class 10, has alleged that a grade IV employee, Rakesh Chaurasia, tried to rape her on March 22. "He dragged me into a corner and tried to rape me. I managed to escape after my friend Suman raised an alarm," Nisha told reporters in Kushinagar on Wednesday. 

Another girl, Reena (name changed), has accused another grade IV employee, D N Gupta, of raping her several times. The complaints of these two girls were endorsed by other girls who spoke to the local media. "All this had been happening for quite some time. We had informed the warden and the principal but no action was taken," a girl said. 

The girls claimed they were kept under strict vigil. "We were not even allowed to go on the terrace or in the open space in evenings," a girl said.
