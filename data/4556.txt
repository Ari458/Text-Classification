Murder, Dowry Harassment
Description:
			A woman was murdered by her mother-in-law near Bodi in Theni district. The incident happened just two weeks before she was to celebrate her wedding anniversary. The deceased is Bhoopathy, 23, wife of Satheesh Kumar.

Satheesh, 26, had married Bhoopathy, in Pudukottai in April last year. As she did not bring any dowry her mother-in-law Sulochana was furious.

The couple fell in love while working in a textile shop in Chennai, according to a fact-finding team deputed by Evidence, an NGO. Their marriage had been opposed by both the families.

Once, the woman's father had filed an abduction case against Satheesh, following which the couple and their parents were summoned to the police station on April 19, 2013.

But Satheesh's mother often harassed Bhoopathy for not bring any dowry. Four months ago, the girl's family was asked to pay Rs 2 lakh and 10 sovereigns of gold.

On April 3, Sulochana tied up Bhoopathy and forced her to consume pesticide tablets. This resulted in her death a little later. Sulochana confessed to the murder and was arrested along with her husband, Kannan, for murder.

According to the NGO, 25 honour killings have taken place in Tamil Nadu in the last 18 months, but this particular case shows that young women are being killed due to their poor economical status.

The NGO has demanded that the girl's family be given a compensation of Rs 10 lakh and that the murderer be booked under the Goondas Act.
