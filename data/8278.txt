Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			The Uran police, on Thursday, arrested a 44-year-old watchman for allegedly raping his own minor daughter, who is now six months pregnant.
Two days ago, the police got a tip off that a 15-year-old girl had been hospitalised as she was pregnant.

On further inquiry, the police found that that the minor had been raped several times by her own father, who worked as a private security guard.

The police then lodged a suo moto FIR against the accused under Prevention of Child Sexual Offences Act (POCSO).

Senior inspector, Rajendra Galande said that the minor victim is the daughter of the accused from his first marriage. She was staying with him and his second wife, after the watchman had remarried.

"Since it is a case of sexual abuse of a minor girl, who is currently quite nervous and worried about her situation, we have also contacted the state committee of women and child welfare, as is usually done in cases under POCSO. A detailed statement of the girl will be taken by the committee," Galande added.
Normally, the police wait for a close family member or the victim to come forward and lodge a complaint but in this situation, the cops filed a suo moto case as it was confirmed that the minor girl is pregnant. Also, the immediate arrest of the accused is laudable, said a city activist.
