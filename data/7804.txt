Domestic Violence, Dowry Harassment
Description:
			A man has been arrested for allegedly harassing his daughter-in-law for dowry in northeast Delhi's Khajuri Khas area on Wednesday.

The victim has been identified as 22-year-old Manju. The matter came to light when the complainant filed a case against her husband, father-in-law and his wife on Wednesday.

"She came to the Khajuri Khas police station and filed a case against her father-in-law and husband who she said have been harassing her for the past one year for not fulfilling their dowry demands. She also showed us a few injury marks, which were inflicted by her husband. We have arrested Vibhas (47) who is her father-in-law, and a search has been initiated against her husband Hemant (27), who is absconding," said a senior police official.

The family lives in Dayalpur area. The couple got married one-and-a-half-year ago and has no child. Manju told police that her husband is unemployed and therefore regularly demands money from her father to fulfill his desires. When she objects, he resorts to physical violence too, she told police.

"We have registered a case against all the three members and probe regarding the matter have been initiated. The girl was sent to her paternal house after providing her with medical aid," police said.
