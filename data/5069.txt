Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A minor girl was allegedly raped by a 21-year-old youth a few days ago at Bakkannapalem on the outskirts of the city, but the incident came to light on Monday after the cops arrested the accused.

According to the police, the accused, Chinna, a native of Srikakulam district, worked as a mason at Sri Surya Constructions, where the victim was working as a daily wage labourer, near the Bakkanapalem area.

Chinna allegedly took the girl to Srikakulam district forcibly and raped her repeatedly. However, sources said that Chinna and the girl had eloped after they got into a relationship. The girl's father, who was a watchman at the construction site, went to Srikakulam after he learnt that his daughter was taken to Srikakulam by the youth and brought her back to the city on Sunday night. He lodged a complaint with the police station on Monday.

Based on the complaint, the police arrested Chinna under various sections of the IPC. According to police station inspector Ch Tirupathi Rao, though prima facie it appears to be a case of consensual sex, it is still an offence as the girl is a minor. The girl was sent to King George Hospital for medical examination.
