Crime
Description:
			32 yr old Bareilly medical representative stuck in an unhappy marriage took his newly-wed second wife to Mussoorie on the pretext of honeymoon, stoned her and drove a nail into her body, killing her earlier this week. 

Sachin Mishra dumped Kanak's body in a forest some 25 km from Dehradun on Wednesday before leaving for Rishikesh, where he concocted her drowning story, the police said. He claimed Kanak had been swept away while taking a dip in the Ganga. 

Dehradun SSP G N Goswami said Mishra told his interrogators that he was forced to divorce his first wife last year a few months after their marriage because she was related to him. He was forced to leave her after relatives objected. He took Kanak as his second wife two months ago but could not get over the divorce. Mishra stayed in touch with his first wife and that led to frequent arguments between the couple.
