Dowry Harassment, Other
Description:
			Frustrated by alleged harassment for dowry by husband and in-laws, a 26-year-old woman allegedly committed suicide by hanging herself from the ceiling fan at her residence in Rahatani.

The deceased, Jyoti Singh, was a resident of Akash Ganga society in Rahatani. The police arrested Jyoti's husband, Sameer, who works as a software engineer with a city-based company.

Sub-inspector M P Sonawane said, "Jyoti was found hanging from the ceiling fan in the living room of the flat. Her father Adityakumar has lodged a complaint against Sameer and his parents." Jyoti was alone in the house when the incident happened, he added.

Sonawane said Sameer and Jyoti got married in February 2012. The couple had been staying in Rahatani ever since. Jyoti, who had done MA in English, was pursuing her BEd from a city college. "In his complaint, Adityakumar has alleged that Sameer and his parents used to mentally and physically torture his daughter. They were demanding a car from Jyoti as was promised by him (Adityakumar) before the wedding. The complainant has also alleged that Sameer used to mentally torture Jyoti by saying that she was not well-educated and her height did not match his," Sonawane said.

Sonawane said Sameer has been arrested under section 304 (b) (dowry death) and 498 (a) (husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty) of the Indian Penal Code. "Sameer was produced before the court. He has been remanded in police custody," he said.
