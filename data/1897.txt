Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			A District Forest Officer of State-owned Jungle Lodges and Resorts Limited has been accused of sexually harassing a 30-year-old receptionist working in the head office.

The woman, who has been working as a receptionist for the past two years in the Head office in Khanija Bhavan on Race Course Road , alleged in her complaint that DFO K.M.B. Prasad offered her permanent posting and salary hike on the condition that she cooperate with him.

Suspecting his intentions, she rejected the offer which reportedly agitated Prasad, who started calling her on her mobile demanding that she meet him outside the office. He started shouting at me saying I was not thinking practically and not serious on the career growth, the woman said in the complaint. She accused the official of stating that he would help her to get the job confirmed if she was ready to cooperate with him.

The petrified woman tried to ignore his calls on her mobile and even warned him that she would complain to the Managing Director, but Prasad started calling her on board line stating that he would come to her house for dinner.

Notwithstanding her resistance, Prasad continued to call her and passed remarks on her physical appearance, she alleged.
