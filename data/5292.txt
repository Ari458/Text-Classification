Child Sexual Abuse, Molestation, Crime
Description:
			A girl who was set on fire after she resisted attempt to molest her in chief minister Vasundhara Raje's hometown Dholur was shifted to a hospital in Jaipur on Tuesday. Ironically, the accused happenepd to be her relatives. She has sustained 60 per cent burns.
In her statement, the 17-year old girl told the police that the accused were her uncle and two cousins who lived right across her house.
The incident took place on the day of Raksha Bandhan.
Following her statement, the police detained the accused for questioning.
The police registered a case of attempt to murder, trespass and one under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences, or Posco Act.
All four had allegedly barged into the house when they found the girl alone her mother had gone visiting other relatives on the occasion of Raksha Bandhan.
When she resisted their attempts to molest her, they sprinkled kerosene on her and set her on fire.
The neighbours, though, appear convinced that the girl had attempted suicide. And the extended family claims the men are being framed.
Their house is next to ours. The girl and her sisters were at home when the incident supposedly took place. There appears to have been an altercation among them. The men are being framed without any reason, said one of the relatives of the accused men.
The incident brings into focus the rising number of crimes against women. Two months ago, two rape cases in the chief minister's constituency had sent shock waves and the Congress had lost no time to attack her government. In 2013, the Vasundhara Raje government had come to power with a key promise of improving the law and order situation.
But Rajasthan still figures among the five states that report the highest number of crimes against women.
