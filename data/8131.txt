Description:
			An 18-year-old is battling for her life in Delhi after being raped by over 10 men for 6 months.

Unable to sit, talk or walk, she has been admitted to Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital with severe injuries all over the body and infections all over her legs. I have been taken to Rishikesh, Haridwar, Manali, Mangalore and many other locations and kept at someones place where people used to come and rape me. This happened for over six months and traffickers used to beat me up on refusal,the girl said.

Trafficked from West Bengal, the doctors claim that her health is deteriorating because of repeated sexual assault. The likely cause of infection is repeated sexual assault. She was brought here by a man who claimed to be her relative. But after her condition deteriorated, the person also disappeared,said a doctor at the hospital to HT.

While she has no one to look after her, the relatives of other patients have come to her aid.

Shakti Vahini, an NGO, had been trying to locate her since April, and were informed by Kolkata police on Monday about her whereabouts.  The girl has been diagnosed with Septic Arthritis, and displayed visible lacerations in and around her mouth consistent with gag wounds. She lies in a critical state, unable to make use of her lower limbs. The victim has reported about sexual abuse and multiple sexual assaults over the last six months. She has also reported about her being used in prostitution rackets, said Ravi Kant, president of Shakti Vahini.

They have demanded an inquiry into the hospital records to determine the identity of the person who brought her to the hospital.
