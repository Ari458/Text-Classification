Rape
Description:
			Nandan, 30, a resident of Mukund Vihar in north-west Delhi had kidnapped his 6-year-old niece when she was playing with her brother and took her to his house on the pretext of giving her ice-cream and raped her in April last year. 

He had previously also tried to sexually assault women of his own family but to save their honour, he was not punished by the family. 

The court noted that the minor was rescued from the clutches of the convict by her mother and aunt who went to his house in search of the girl. They had found the injured child crying while Nandan was sleeping after committing the crime. 

The judge further said the victim is suffering from recurrent infections after the incident and is undergoing medical treatment in Rajasthan and the possibility of the convict transmitting the infectious disease cannot be ruled out.
