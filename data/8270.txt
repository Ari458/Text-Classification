Description:
			On a minor girl's complaint, Kalamna police booked 22-year-old Guddu Sahu for allegedly raping her eight months ago. The minor, aged 15, claimed that she was frightened and thus reported the complaint late.

The minor told police that she was alone at home when Sahu, a resident of Shyam Nagar, came home, threatened her and raped her. The girl shared the incident with her neighbours who then encouraged her to file a complaint. Police booked Sahu on rape charges and arrested him.
