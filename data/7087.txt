Rape
Description:
			A 35-year-old cab driver, who lured a woman under the pretext of handing over free clothes and sexually assaulted her, has been arrested by the city police.

Police suspect the man, who has served a prison term in the past for raping a school girl, could have been involved in other similar sexual assault cases in the past.

Suresh Kumar raped the 45-year-old woman, a domestic help, and pushed her out of a car in Neelankarai on Saturday afternoon. Neelankarai police said the woman was on her way to work when a Tata Indica Car pulled over around 2 p.m. on Saturday.

Suresh Kumar told her that his owner was distributing free garments to poor people and promised to drop her back home. The women fell for the lie and got into the car. He drove to East Coast Road, raped her and then sped away after pushing her out of the car, city police sources said. The woman managed to reach Neelankarai police station with the help of motorists and passers-by on ECR, and filed a complaint. After receiving her complaint, police traced the car number and established that it belonged to a travel company in Somu Nagar, Medavakkam.

Based on the information they got from the owner and another driver, they picked up Suresh Kumar from Palavakkam, police sources added.
