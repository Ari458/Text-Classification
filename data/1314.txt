Rape
Description:
			The court held the girls' consent was not valid in law, saying that Somdev was conscious of the fact that had he not promised to marry the victim, she would have never allowed him the physical intimacy with her. Somdev not only concealed his marriage but even faked his own death to get rid of her. 

Somdev came in contact with the victim in 2009. They became friends. However, he started persuading her for a physical relationship to which the girl consented after he promised to marry her.
