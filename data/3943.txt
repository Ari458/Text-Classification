Rape
Description:
			BJD MLA from Udala in Mayurbhanj district and his friend were booked on Monday for alleged gang-rape.

The BJD legislator, identified as Srinath Soren, and his friend Swarup Das, were booked by the police following a complaint lodged by a 40-year-old woman.

She accused Soren and Das of raping her on January 3 at the MLA's house in Udala. The woman alleged she recently gave Rs 1 lakh to Soren and Das for a job in a government department. When she did not get the job, she went to the MLA's house to ask for her money when they allegedly gang-raped her.

"Based on the woman's complaint at Udala police station, we registered cases against the MLA and his aide. The woman was subjected to medical examination," Mayurbhanj SP, Nikhil Kanodia told TOI.

Soren, however, scotched the charges. "It is a conspiracy against me. The accusations are false and baseless," Soren said, adding he knew the woman.
