Description:
			Railway Protection Force (RPF) on Monday arrested the youth who eve-teased, molested and attempted rape on a girl inside a local train on the Western Railway last Thursday. 

The accused, Sushant Yadav (19), was arrested from the footpath before the SBI Building at Fort in Mumbai. 

Incidentally, he was wearing the same blue-colour T-shirt and red shorts, as he was seen in WR CCTV footage, Senior Divisional Railway Security Commissioner Anand Vijay Jha said. 
The boy initially gave evasive answers. 

The girl, an MBA hailing from Pune, boarded the Borivli-Churchgate train from Malad suburbs on the Western Railway Thursday night.  

The incident happened between Grant Road and Charni Road stations as the train was a few kilometres away from its terminal point. When the girl resisted and repulsed the attack, the boy jumped out of the train as it slowed near Marine Lines and fled the scene. 

The accused was handed over to the Government Railway Police (GRP), which is investigating the matter.
