Description:
			The caretaker of an orphanage was arrested on charges of repeatedly raping a 15-year old mentally-challenged girl over a period of time, in Kuttaiyur on Monday.

The incident came to light when the victim narrated the tale to a social activist, who had gone to the orphanage to donate provisions.

Police said that the girl had been staying at the orphanage for the past 10 years. The victim had approached the activist alleging that Vanagamudi (57), a resident of Thirumal street in Marakkadai, had sexually assaulted her on numerous occasions.

After coming to know of the abuse, the activist informed the members of his welfare group and later lodged a complaint against Vanagamudi with the Karamadai police.

A case under under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012, was registered against Vanagamudi and he was arrested.
