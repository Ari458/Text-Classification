Crime, Rape
Description:
			Four persons have been sentenced by a court in Dimapur for gangraping a woman last year.

The Dimapur District and Session Judge, S Hukato Swu sentenced three persons to 15 years rigorous imprisonment for the gangrape of the woman.

Another person who did not commit rape but acted with the common intention was awarded 10-years rigorous imprisonment by the District and Sessions Judge.

However, the prime accused, Manik Ali who incited the attack on the victims husband before rape was committed, is still absconding.

The husband was physically assaulted but managed to flee and inform the nearby colony residents.
