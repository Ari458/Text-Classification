Description:
			Four members of a gang stabbed a 20-year-old man to death after he intervened when they attempted to rape a woman hawker on a disused platform at Pallavaram railway station at 9.30pm on Monday. 

Police said John Shanthakumar, 24, a resident of Maraimalai Nagar, was rushing to catch last local train to Chengalpet when he saw the gang molesting a fruit vendor. A friend of his, a loadman named Rajan, was with Shanthakumar, who worked as a house painter, at the time. 

"We identified the suspects," Government Railway Police assistant commissioner of police V Pon Ramu said. "One of them is Karthik from Chetpet. We will nab them in a day or two." 

The gang robbed another passenger Sri Ramalu, 30, a house painter from Andhra Pradesh, of 5,000 and a cellphone outside the station on Monday. When he resisted, a gang member slashed him with a knife, cutting his ear, and grabbed the money and phone. 

An investigating officer said John Shanthakumar, who lived in Union Carbide Colony nearby, often went to the unused platform to meet two women, Bhavani and Sangeetha, who lived on the platform and worked as vendors by day. 

The officer said the gang grabbed Bhavani and dragged her to a dark spot. "When she cried out for help, John and his friend tried to stop them," he said. Angry at the interference, the gang attacked Shanthakumar and assaulted him. 

"They then dragged him to the far end of the platform where they stabbed him to death," the investigating officer said.
