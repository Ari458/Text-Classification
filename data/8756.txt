Dowry Harassment
Description:
			A 22-year-old woman from Pollachi committed suicide on Thursday night after her husband and in-laws harassed her for dowry. The police have arrested her husband and two others, while the rest are absconding. 

The deceased was identified as Kalpana alias Kaleeshwari S. Her father Selvaraj is a tempo driver and her mother Parameshwari is a maid in a nutritious meal scheme centre. On June 8, Kaleeshwari got married to Senthilvel N, 30 and they settled down in Tirupur. 

Senthilvel and his parents Narayansamy and Malini, his sisters Chitra and Nithya, and his brothers-in-law Saravana and Raja began harassing Kaleeshwari for the remaining 10 sovereigns. This led to several fights between the couple, the official added. 

As Diwali neared, Senthilvel began mounting pressure on Kaleeshwari. 

Kaleeshwari had repeatedly tried explaining to her in-laws and Senthilvel that it would be difficult for her father to arrange for the remaining gold, but Senthil did not relent. Unable to bear the torture, Kaleeshwari returned to her father's house in Pollachi. She did not return to Tirupur even after Diwali. She became depressed and decided to end her life as she did not want to burden her family. She hanged herself using her sari, the police said.
