Domestic Violence, Murder, Dowry Harassment
Description:
			Police on Sunday arrested an ex-serviceman after he was charged with killing his wife in an incident reported at Nizampatnam here.

The accused, Seelam Lenin, had fled the Army and married Surya Gouthami last year. The marriage, which was initially opposed by the families of both, as they belonged to different castes, soon ran into trouble.

Police said neighbours had warned Lenin several times against beating Gouthami. They added that Lenin, an alcoholic, reportedly used to torture his wife, demanding that she sell off the 50 cents her parents had given her in dowry. On Saturday evening, the accused allegedly strangled his wife at his house and hung the body from the ceiling fan. Police said the victim's neck bore injury marks.

Based on a complaint lodged by Gouthami's father Srinivasa Rao, police registered cases under Section 302 and 201 of the Indian Penal Code. Nizampatnam Sub-Inspector of Police Sk. Shafi said that Lenin had been taken into custody, and that he would be produced before court on Monday.

Lenin used to torture his wife demanding that she sell the land in her name.
