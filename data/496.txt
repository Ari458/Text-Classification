Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A 21-year-old father of two has been jailed for 10 years by a Delhi court for raping his six-year-old niece on June 21, 2010.

On the day of the incident, the victim was playing with her younger brother outside their house in south-west Delhi when Vinod came up to her and took her to a deserted spot in a rickshaw.

He raped the girl and when she cried, he threatened to slit her throat, asking her not to disclose it to anyone. Vinod then left the traumatised girl at a temple close to her locality from where she went home and slept. Her medical report confirmed rape and the minor was sent for counselling by an NGO through the Delhi commission for women.

"The offence for which the convict is being sentenced, is grave, heinous and utterly abominable. Such an act of perversity has to be dealt with strictly and sternly," said Additional Sessions Judge Mamta Tayal.
