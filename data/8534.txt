Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			The Worli police on Thursday night arrested a 51-year-old man on charges of raping a nine-year-old girl who resided in his chawl. The accused fled from Worli after he realized the survivor had narrated the incident to her parents.

Vinay Kulkarni, senior police inspector of the Worli police station, identified the accused as Rambali Saroj, a resident of Manjrekar lane in Worli. "Saroj is into the horsecart renting business," said Kulkarni.

On Wednesday night, Saroj allegedly called the girl, who was playing in the chawl, inside his stable on the pretext of giving her money for chocolates. "Since the incident, the girl was going through acute pain and broke down. Her mother took her to a doctor who suggested she inform the police. The mother, along with the girl, went to the police station, where a case was registered," said a police officer.

The girl underwent a test at the Nagpada police hospital, where a preliminary report confirmed rape.
