Murder
Description:
			A 55-year-old widow was beaten to death allegedly by her two daughters-in-law in Aamdih tola of Kandesai village under suspicion of practising witchcraft, a top police officer said.

One of the daughter-in-laws, identified as Janki Chetumba, and four villagers were arrested on twin charges of lynching the woman and then setting the body on fire, the officer said adding half-burnt body of the widow has been recovered.

The officer said the hapless elderly woman attracted ire after Janki consulted an 'Ojha' (witch doctor) who was not keeping well for past some time and the witch doctor branded her mother-in-law as a witch.

Janki then roped in the elder daughter-in-law and the duo they beat up their mother-in-law casing her death last night, the officer said.

As Janki allegedly took help of some villagers and tried to set the body on fire, a police team went to the spot and recovered the half-burnt body, which was sent to M G M Hospital, Jamshedpur for post-mortem.

Both sons of the victim were working outside when the incident took place, the officer said.
