Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			The state labour department has ordered a departmental inquiry against welfare commissioner Mohan Dhotre into allegations of sexual harassment.

Two committees, appointed to inquire into the allegations, including sexual harassment, financial misappropriation and illegal recruitment, ruled to terminate the commissioner from service.

But, ministers from the labour department turned down the recommendation and restricted the punishment to revoking two of his increments.
