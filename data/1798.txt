Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A 13-year-old school girl has given birth to a baby boy at SUT Hospital, hospital sources said here today.
 
It was alleged that the girl was sexually assaulted after being drugged in the school.

A few days ago, she was hospitalised by her parents due to pregnancy-related health problems.

Though the parents were hesitant to file a complaint, the hospital authorities informed the incident to the police two days later citing the seriousness of the issue.
