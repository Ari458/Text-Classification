Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A 16-year-old girl was allegedly gang-raped by three youths in Chhattisgarh's Jashpur district.

The incident took place when the victim was returning to her home after attending a wedding function in Jharkhand last evening, Jashpur Additional Superintendent of Police (ASP) Neha Pandey said.

The minor girl, a native of Korba district, had gone to her paternal aunt's home in Gumla (Jharkhand) to attend a marriage ceremony, where she befriended a boy who reportedly promised to meet her at the Jashpur bus stand, Pandey said.

The girl, who was waiting for the bus at the Jashpur bus stand along with her uncle and aunt, left their company for a while to meet her friend from Jharkhand.

On finding her alone there, three youths forcibly took her to a nearby tourist spot where they allegedly gang-raped her.

They later dumped her at the bus stand late last night.

On the girl's complaint, the three accused - Shubh Nayak, Sandeep Nayak and Gopi Nayak - all aged between 20 to 30 years, were arrested, the ASP said.
