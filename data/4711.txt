Description:
			A 15-year-old girl who was allegedly sold into marriage three years ago and later forced into prostitution has been rescued in a joint operation by police and NGOs.

The girl, a resident of Najafgarh in Delhi, was allegedly sold into marriage for Rs 4 lakhs by her family when she was just 12-years-old.

Within a week of arriving at her in-laws home, her husband sexually assaulted her and forced her into prostitution, police said.

"The first time I was sold to a man in Gurgaon for Rs 5,000, he raped me for two hours," the victim was quoted as saying by Bachpan Bachao Andolan (BBA), the organisation which helped rescue the victim from Patauda village of Haryana.

Police have registered a case under section 4 of Protection Of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, Section 372/373 (selling and buying of minors for prostitution) and Section 376 of Indian Penal Code (rape) and the accused husband has been arrested.

BBA's Rakesh Senger said that efforts are on to have the victim's family in Najafgarh arrested too as they were aware of the girl's plight and did nothing to stop it.

The victim had managed to get in touch with ApneAap Women Worldwide, an NGO which soon contacted BBA. Together with the local police, the girl was rescued.

The young victim told her rescuers that she often tried to escape the torture, and even managed to run back home, but said her parents sent her back.

She finally approached ApneAap Women Worldwide who got in touch with BBA and managed to rescue the victim from Patauda.
