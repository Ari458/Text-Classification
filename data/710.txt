Description:
			Kendrapada Sadar police on Sunday registered a case against a renowned Ollywood cinematographer after his wife filed a written complaint alleging dowry torture. 
During their marriage, Jyotirmayee's family had provided dowry as per demand.

Jyotirmayee further mentioned in the FIR that everything went as usual for two months after marriage. But later, Sitanshu forced her to bring Rs3 lakh more as dowry. When her family members failed to provide such a huge amount, she was victimised both physically and mentally by her spouse and in-laws. Though at a later stage her family members provided a sum of Rs1 lakh to Sitanshu, he did not relent and continued torturing her.
