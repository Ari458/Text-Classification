			Jhunjhunu police on Saturday arrested a trader and his friend for gang raping a minor girl in Jhunjhunu. The duo, along with one more man, is accused of taking away the girl from her home on the pretext that her mother had met with an accident and they were taking her to the hospital. Instead, they took her to an isolated place and raped her. The police launched an investigation after the girl's mother lodged an FIR against the trio. The search is on for the third accused, officials said.

According to police, trader Pramod Kumar and his two friends, including Sushil, were harassing the girl's mother over phone for the past few days. The mother was not home on Thursday when Pramod called on her mobile.

The girl told Pramod that her mother was not home. Pramod came to her house a few minutes later and told her that the mother had met with an accident. He told the girl that he came to know about the accident when he was trying to find her.

Pramod asked her to come with them so that they could take her to her mother, admitted in a hospital. The trio, however, took her to an abandoned house where they raped her and escaped. The girl reached home and narrated the incident to her mother. The mother then lodged an FIR with the police. The police carried out a medical examination on the victim and arrested Pramod and Sushil.

The medical report proved that the girl was raped. The accused were booked under various sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offenses Act.
