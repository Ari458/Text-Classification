Rape, Abuse
Description:
			AKOLA: A gang of four persons, including a couple, were arrested on Monday for pushing a 17-year-old minor girl from Bangladesh into prostitution and sexually assaulting her for two months.

The illegal flesh trade came to light when the girl managed to escape from the custody of the accused and took shelter at a nearby house. When she narrated the incident, the woman who had given her protection, took her to a police station and the racket was busted.

The girl was shifted from one place to another on contract basis by those who purchased her from the partners in the crime. She was first sold to Subrato for Rs 30 at Dhaka in Bangladesh on December 27 2011. She was then purchased at Kolkata railway station by Sonu who took her to Surat in Gujarat and earned lakhs of rupees. Sonu then handed her over to Krishna at Thane. Krishna too earned money by forcing her into prostitution. Then Krishna struck a deal with Dhumal who purchased her for 17 days on contract. Dhumal brought her to Akola and handed her over to Bhakre of Lahan Umri here.
