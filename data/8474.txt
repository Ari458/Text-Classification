Rape, Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			The Karnataka police arrested an assistant priest of the popular Kateel Durgaparameshwari temple in Mangaluru for raping a 19-year-old girl.

Though the incident took place last year, it came to light recently after the victim approached a hospital seeking abortion.

According to the police, Harishchandra Rao (56) alias Appu Bhatta allegedly raped the girl, who worked at his home in August 2015. The girl became pregnant and the priest tried for a compromise by offering her monetary compensation involving local leaders.

The girl was adamant on abortion and visited a hospital sometime in November. However, they refused to terminate the pregnancy and Appu Bhatta allegedly tried to prevail over the hospital management.

Later, the hospital management learnt the truth and informed the police. The victim approached the Bajpe police and lodged a complaint. Appu Bhatta was taken into custody and produced before a local court, which remanded him in judicial custody.
