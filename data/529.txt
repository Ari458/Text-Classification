Abduction, Molestation
Description:
			A woman from Tamil Nadu who got into an auto rickshaw from the railway station at Thalassery was taken to the beach and molested by an unidentified gang.

According to the local people, the police persuaded her to board a train bound for Tamil Nadu, instead of taking her to a hospital or provide medical treatment.

The police version was that the woman had no complaint of harassment by any one.

Disputing the police argument, the AIDWA leader said that the police statement that there was no complaint relating to the incident from the woman couldn't be believed.
