Domestic Violence, Murder
Description:
			Even as the gruesome incident of a son killing his mother and grandmother in Anantapur is yet to wean off the public memory, a person hacked to death his wife while severely injuring his child.

According to the Rayadurgam police, Harijana Raju (30) attacked his wife Harijana Chittemma (25) and son Aravind Kumar (5) while they were asleep in their maternal house in Kenchanapalli village, 28 km from Rayadurgam.

The police said that the accused had attacked the mother-son duo at around 4 a.m. on Wednesday injuring Chittemma severely, who bled to death on the spot in a few minutes, while his son, who was also attacked, survived the attack with severe injuries.

The accused and his family had travelled from the Beluguppa village of the Uravakonda mandal to Kenchanapalli village of the Rayadurgam mandal, which is the maternal home town of Harijana Chittemma a few days ago on account of the Moharram celebrations.

The Rayadurgam Sub Inspector of Police B. Mahanandi told The Hindu that preliminary enquiry into the murder had revealed that the accused had taken to the gruesome step as he harboured a doubt on the fidelity of his wife.

Meanwhile, the accused is out at large after he escaped from the crime scene.
