Description:
			In a video that took the internet by storm on Tuesday, a 45-year-old Bijnor housewife is seen bashing up her ill and infirm 70-year-old mother-in-law even as the helpless old woman wails for help, unable to fend off the blows that keep raining on her. At one point, the daughter-in-law, identified now as 45-year-old Sangeeta Jain, attempts to strangle her victim using a piece of cloth as some sort of a noose.

Police have now arrested Jain and charged her with attempt to murder, but not before there were agonised voices on social media platforms that asked how someone could be so brutal. In the minute-long video, Jain can be seen attempting to electrocute her mother-in-law with a water heating rod. This comes after she picks up a piece of stone and hammers the old woman's head with it.

The video was recorded in the family's Nehtaur home in secret by the woman's businessman husband. He had installed the CCTV camera on suspicion that his wife had been abusing his parents when he was out of the house. The footage that went viral was from January 5.

On Tuesday morning, the woman's husband Sandeep Jain filed a police complaint in the matter. His wife was later arrested and charged under Sections 307 (attempt to murder) and 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) of IPC.

The couple had been married for seven years. Talking to TOI, Jain said, "Minor arguments would occur and some of those would be dragged to the court. Just a little over a year into marriage, she filed a case of dowry harassment against me and wanted divorce."
