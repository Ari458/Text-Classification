Molestation
Description:
			While on one hand there are instances of foreign tourists becoming victims of sexual abuse, a completely different incident took place in Rajsthan Mandore gardens near Jodhpur, where a stone-crusher labourer risked his own life in order to save two French women tourists from molestation.

The stone-crusher labourer Pukhraj Rajput, while on work, saw two French women being abused sexually by two men who posed as guides. 

The two youths, one from Bihar, Mubarak (22) son of Shamaluddin, and another from Jodhpur Zeeshan Khilji (21), son of Barkatullah took the French women to Mandore gardeb for sight-seeing. There they took them to a deserted area and began molesting them.

Pukhraj who was working nearby saw the women screaming. Not becoming a mute witness to the ill-treatment, Pukhraj picked up stones from the ground and began pelting them at the two youths. He also informed his friends and called them over for help.   

Meanwhile, the two youths fled the place and hid inside a city bus. Pukhraj's friends looked for the men and handed them over to police later.
