Child Sexual Abuse, Rape, Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			The Anna Nagar police on Monday arrested a 45-year-old computer teacher of a private school in Arumbakkam for sexually assaulting a Class 3 student in the school. 

The girl's parents came to know about the incident only after she complained of pain and was taken to a private hospital from where she was sent to Government Children Hospital in Egmore. Doctors found she had been sexually assaulted and informed police. The child, who suffered bruises on her private parts, told her mother that computer teacher James Maria Gnanaraj took her to a room in the school and assaulted her. Police soon picked up James, a Kodambakkam resident, and interrogations revealed that he lured the child to an unoccupied class room on the third floor and assaulted her several times for more than three months. 

"He had scared the girl into not revealing the matter to her parents. He told her to say she hurt herself while playing," said an investigating officer.
