Child Sexual Abuse, Murder, Rape
Description:
			Panic gripped Karni Vihar locality on Monday morning when people spotted a body of a 5-year-old girl lying in an empty plot of land. The body was stuffed in a sack. The preliminary investigation hinted that the girl was probably raped and then murdered.

While conducting further probe, the police arrested a 28-year-old labourer, who reportedly confessed to killing the girl.

According to the police, the girl was playing outside her home on Sunday evening when the accused, identified as Kamlesh Saunkariya, returned from a slipper-manufacturing factory. The girl went missing and her relatives started searching for her. But when they couldn't find her, they approached the police on Sunday night.

After working on the clues, the police rounded up Saunkariya on Monday. During interrogation, he confessed to killing the girl.

"The accused said he was in an inebriated condition when he took the girl to his room, situated in the same locality, on the pretext of giving her potato chips. The girl screamed when he tried to rape her, so he strangulated her. He also hit her head with a stone," said Kailash Bishnoi, deputy commissioner of police (west).

Bishnoi added, "The accused has said he only attempted to rape her. We have seized his as well as the girl's clothes. The autopsy will ascertain if the girl was raped."

"We will file the chargesheet in 3-4 days. We have a strong case against the accused," he added.

The police said that after killing the girl, the accused stuffed her body in a sack and dumped it in an isolated plot of land which is used by locals for dumping garbage.
