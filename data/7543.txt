Abduction, Molestation
Description:
			A 30-year-old woman, working with a NGO, has alleged that she was kidnapped and molested by three people in a moving car here, police said on Saturday.

The woman claimed that she was kidnapped from west Delhi's Hari Nagar area around 10.30 p.m. on Friday when she was waiting for an auto-rickshaw to reach home.

In her complaint to police, she also said that there were three men in the car who molested her and pushed her outside the vehicle in Binda Pur area an hour after they abducted her.

"As per the complaint of the woman, we have registered a case of molestation against the three accused who are known to her. They have been detained and questioned to verify the woman's allegations," Deputy Commissioner of Police, Pushpendra Kumar, told IANS.

He added that they have found discrepancies in the woman's statement and have "doubts" whether the allegations made by her were correct or she was just trying to trap the men.

"As per her complaint, one of these men is the owner of an under construction building while the two others are his associates," Kumar said.

The woman alleges that she stopped the construction of the building a few weeks back, a development which enraged its owner who along with his associates kidnapped her last night and molested her, the official said.

"But, in their statement to police, the three men made counter allegations against the woman, saying that she was trying to trap them under charges of molestation to derive personal benefits," said Kumar

He said they were making thorough investigations before making any arrests. All the three men are residents of Hari Nagar area, while the woman stays in Tilak Nagar area.
