Domestic Violence, Murder
Description:
			The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court on Thursday rejected the bail application of Chandkhan Ahmedkhan, a resident of Her in Udgir taluka of Latur district, who is accused of murdering his wife by hitting her in the head with a stone in March 2015.

The Udgir (rural) police had registered an offence against Chandkhan and his four relatives under various sections of the IPC, for harassing and murdering Rehanabi Pathan for dowry.

Chandkhan had allegedly been demanding his wife to allow him to marry another woman. This led to frequent quarrels between them, said lawyer Ajinkya Reddy, who assisted the public prosecutor while representing Rehanabi's brother. In March 2015, Chandkhan again picked up a quarrel with his wife and then hit her with a stone, causing her death, while other accused helped him.

An offence was registered against them following a complaint lodged by Shaikh Razzaq, brother of Rehana.

The Udgir sessions court had granted bail to the four other accused but rejected the application of Chandkhan, who was the prime accused. Chandkhan approached the high court through lawyer AS Bayas, saying that investigation in the matter was complete and chargesheet was also filed and thus his dentition was not necessary.

Additional public prosecutor US Mote pointed out that there was a strong prima facie case against Chandkhan and sought rejection of the bail application.While rejecting the bail plea, Justice NW Sambre observed, "Upon perusal of the chargesheet, it is noticed that the contents of the FIR match with the injuries suffered by the body of victim. The statements of witnesses support the prosecution's case."
