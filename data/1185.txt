			On Saturday, A drunk Rupesh demanded Rs 30 from his mother, who was a house wife. His father works as a labourer for a construction company. Nirmala refused to give and reprimanded him for not trying to find a job and asking his parents to pay for his drinking habit. This angered Rupesh, who threatened to assault her.

Neighbours rushed to Nirmala's aid and put out the flames.Nirmala Tukaram Jingare (50), sustained 40% burn injuries and is admitted to a hospital in Mulund.
