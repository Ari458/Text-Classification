Description:
			A 23-year-old Dalit woman was reportedly raped for almost two weeks by her batchmates, in  Karimnagar district of Telangana.

The victim, who aspired to be a police officer, was raped by her batchmates G Srinivas and M Anjaiah, while M Rakesh filmed the crime on his cell phone.

The incident took place on the outskirts of Veenavanka village when the three accused were returning to the village with the complainant and a friend of hers after watching a movie. The trio took the two women to a secluded spot. While one of the women sensed danger and ran away, the other was raped and filmed.

Threatening to post the video clip on social media sites, the three accused, who were also training to join the police force, assaulted her for over 10 days.

The incident came to light when the victim told her parents two days ago, after which her family and the villagers thrashed the accused on February 24 evening.

The three were later admitted to a hospital in the neighbouring Warangal district.

Along with the rape complaint the accused have also been charged under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act and the Information Technology Act.

Karimnagar Superintendent of Police Joey said the delay in registering the case happened only because the girl did not come forward to complain.

Two of the accused are still in hospital while the third Rakesh, who reportedly filmed the crime, is in police custody.

Chennur Sarpanch, Rayamallu said, "Unless there is immediate punishment, rapists will feel they can get away and have no fear of law.'
