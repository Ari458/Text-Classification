Abuse
Description:
			The Jalna police have arrested a man for illegally confining and allegedly raping a 22-year-old woman for a couple of months at a house. The police have also arrested his mother in connection with the case. The woman managed to escape four days ago and reached Aurangabad.

On Monday, the woman was admitted to the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH). She underwent medical examination after which the Begumpura police recorded her statement. Thereafter, the police registered a case against a mother-son duo under Sections 376 (rape), 342 (wrongful confinement), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code.

The case was later referred to the Badnapur police station in Jalna. Upon learning the series of events, the case was then transferred to the Old Jalna police station.

The arrested have been identified as Pralhad Khojekar and his mother Kamlabai Khojekar, both residents of Dhopteshwar in Badnapur tehsil.

As per the complaint lodged by the woman, she went to meet his father in Basar (Telangana) in November 2015. But on her way back to Purna in Parbhani district, the woman's father abandoned her. The woman's parents separated after her father married another woman a few years ago.

Unaware of the way to Purna where her mother resides, the woman got down at Aurangabad railway station. She later went to Jalna railway station, where Pralhad offered to help her reach home.

Falling prey to the suspect's trap, the woman accompanied him and reached his house at Badnapur. Thereafter, she was illegally confined, allegedly raped and even assaulted for a couple of months. She finally managed to escape on January 15.

Later, the woman reached GMCH and stayed in the parking lot for four days. Finally, a man noticed the woman, admitted her to the hospital and told the police.
