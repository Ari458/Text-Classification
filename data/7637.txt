Description:
			A Dalit man, who created a flutter in Villupuram in the recent past by lodging a complaint that his hand and leg were severed for having an affair with a Caste Hindu girl, was arrested by the police on Saturday for harassing the same girl on a bus and remanded in Villupuram sub-jail the same night.

On Thursday, Senthil got onto a minibus after seeing the girl on it and argued with her alleging that she was the reason for everything. He allegedly pulled her shawl when he was stopped by other passengers. The girl's parents lodged a complaint against him. Police arrested Senthil on Saturday evening and presented him at Villupuram court, which remanded him in the sub-jail.

According to sources, Senthil (28) of Ashok Nagar, a mini-bus driver, was on April 16 found lying on the railway track near his village with his right arm and leg chopped off. He was discharged from hospital a few weeks ago after three months of treatment. He had submitted a complaint to SP K S Narendran Nayar of Villipuram stating that he had an affair with a schoolgirl, who was a Caste Hindu, and her uncle allegedly chopped his hand and leg as he was a Dalit. Villupuram town police filed a case and a team was probing into the case.
It was found that Senthil had lost his hand and leg in a train accident and the same was confirmed by the fact-finding team. Police called Senthil to the station and warned him against doing such things as this could create tension between the two communities.

Police said Senthil has a history of such offences. He had already got two years in jail for harassing a woman in 2011 and had attacked this girl's uncle in January.
