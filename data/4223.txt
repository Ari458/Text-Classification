Dowry Harassment
Description:
			About seven years after a woman committed suicide after being harassed for bringing insufficient dowry, justice was delivered when Additional Sessions Judge Baljinder Kaur Sidhu sentenced the deceased's two sisters-in-law and father-in-law to seven years rigorous imprisonment. They court fined each convict Rs 10,000.The court, designated the court for crimes against women, came down heavily on the convicts and recorded in its judgment that the convicts have committed a heinous crime of torturing, harassing and pressurising the deceased, Gurpreet Kaur, by regularly raising the demand fordowry. All three also created miserable circumstances in the house, compelling the poor, helpless girl to take her life. When the question of providing leniency to father-in-law Gulzar Singh was raised by his lawyer on the plea that he was an old man and could hardly walk, the court shot down the appeal .
