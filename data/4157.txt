			A dalit woman working at a brick kiln at Kirra village here was allegedly set ablaze by her employer when she resisted his attempt to rape her.

The woman, who suffered 95 per cent burns, was admitted to the district hospital from where she was referred to Meerut for treatment.

According to police, the brick kiln owner, Aas Mohammad, along with another man sprinkled Kerosene oil and set her on fire after she resisted an alleged attempt by them to rape her on Wednesday evening.
