Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			The Pimpri police on Wednesday detained a 15-year-old boy for sexually assaulting his two minor cousins over the last one year. 

The boy and the girls live in the same locality in Pimpri. In March, the boy sexually assaulted his three-year-old cousin at his house. The girl told her mother who took up the matter with the police. 

The woman said in her complaint that about a year ago the boy had done a similar thing with her five-year-old daughter. "Due to pressure from relatives, the woman did not approach the police then. When her second daughter too faced similar assault, she lodged a complaint with the police," said an officer from the Pimpri police station. 

The alleged assault happened between January 2014 and March this year. Sub-inspector Harish Mane is investigating the case.
