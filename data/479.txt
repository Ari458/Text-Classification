Abduction, Rape
Description:
			A 24-year-old woman was abducted at gunpoint and gangraped in Joshi Nagar area, while an MMS clip was made of her. Though the incident occurred on October 10, the victim reported it to the police on Sunday. She said the accused had threatened to upload the MMS and kill her if she told the police.

In her statement, the victim said on October 10, around 8.45pm she was on her way home from a boutique in Rishi Nagar when four men in a car and four on motorcycles stopped her at gunpoint. She alleged that they took her to a house in Joshi Nagar where they gangraped her and made an MMS clip. The next day they dropped her back where they had abducted her from, she said.


Notes 
1. Making an MMS Clip of the rape and later threatening the victim with the same is savage but is something that the law should/must keep in mind.
2. Is there a way that MMS can be moderated by the Mobile Network operators in India. Or is there a fine line because Privacy of customers (who in some case are PERVERTS) is involved
3. If a victim of MMS blackmail approaches the police, will she be assured that the culprits will be nabbed and the clip deleted?
