Rape
Description:
			Thangjam Manorama Devi, 32, was arrested by the Assam Rifles personnel on the night of July 10, 2004 from her residence in Imphal and her bullet ridden body was found nearby her residential area next morning. The body carried the wounds of tortures on her person. Moreover, she was reportedly raped before killing by the army personnel. 

The security forces arrested the lady as being a suspected link person to a militant outfit of the region and justified their act claiming that Manorama was killed while tried to escape the security net. However, there were no clarifications, why the young lay was sexually abused and the even shot at her private organs with an aim to conceal the proofs of rape. 
   
The incident evoked unprecedented protest against the security forces, which tempted a dozen Meitei women to parade naked in front of the western gate of Kangla Fort, the then headquarter of the Assam Rifles. The unbelievable protest of the conservative women on July 15 (2004) was followed by a month long stir demanding the repeal of AFSPA. The entire state was in turmoil that witnessed numerous demonstrations by the common people, primarily led by women activists.
