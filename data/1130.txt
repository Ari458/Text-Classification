A year ago, Ufiya Ghosh (36 he along with co-accused Raju Haldar (26) visited their native place and met the girl. They then escorted her to the city.

According to the police, the same day the miscreants called some customers to rape her in exchange for money. Whenever the girl refused to cooperate, they threatened and tortured her. She was often starved and never allowed to leave the house. The accused also deliberately burned her on some occasions. On Tuesday afternoon when the house was empty, the girl saw an opportunity and managed to escape. She ran a short distance but soon fainted due to her weak physical and mental state.
