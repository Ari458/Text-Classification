Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A nine-year-old girl was allegedly raped repeatedly by three men, including her paternal uncle and grandmother's lover.

More shocking was the fact that the one of the alleged rapist was encouraged by his wife. The girl's grandmother, however, was unaware of the ordeal the child has been undergoing since 2012.

The Kuttampuzha police, who arrested a woman and her husband, were hunting for the two other suspects, also close to the girl's family. A case was registered under sections 376 (rape), 377 (unnatural offences), 506(2) (criminal intimidation) of the IPC and sections 6 and 9 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act and Section 23 of Juvenile Justice Act.

The minor's trauma started in 2012, soon after her father's death. After her mother abandoned her, she was taken to her maternal home, where she was sexually abused by her grandmother's live-in partner.

Later, she was taken to her father's home, where her paternal uncle abused the girl and even forced the child to watch porn clips on his mobile phone.

A few days later, the child was taken back to the grandmother's house, where an elderly woman offered the girl to her 57-year-old husband. These two were arrested.

The child's plight came to light when she confided the matter in her teacher, who informed an NGO working and the girl's mother. The mother approached the police.
