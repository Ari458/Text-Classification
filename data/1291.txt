Abuse
Description:
			A mother of two hanged herself on Wednesday night after some local youths morphed some obscene photos of her and circulated them through MMS. 

Jesmina Bibi, 28, a resident of Bakdanga in Domkal, could not bear the humiliation and jeering by neighbours and killed herself.

Her husband Bablu Sheikh alleged that the youths, helped by a woman neighbour, superimposed Jesmina's face on a nude body and went about circulating it.
