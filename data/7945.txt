Description:
			A 22-year-old woman from Khar on Friday lodged a rape complaint against her former live-in boyfriend. The survivor has said that she met the 25-year-old tailor, whose shop was in the same area where she worked as a telephone operator. As the man had promised to marry her, they started to live together in Nalasopara for a year. No arrest has been made yet.

When she got pregnant, the man took her to his parents' house in Bandra (east). They told her that their marriage would be possible only if she got an abortion done. The survivor has claimed that her boyfriend used to beat her up. She has alleged that he took her to Uttar Pradesh where she was forced to abort.

In her complaint, she said that her lover introduced her to a woman who, he said, was his aunt. She used to assault the survivor and forced her to swallow some pills. The survivor told the police that she passed out and was later told by the aunt that she had delivered a stillborn.

A rape case was lodged at Khar police station on Friday. It has been transferred to Tulinj police station, Nalasopara, where the two lived.
