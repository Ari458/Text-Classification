Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			Jashpur police on Wednesday arrested three youths for gang-raping a 16-year-old visually impaired tribal girl multiple times soon after which the girl got pregnant and delivered a baby. 

The incident came to light after two and half months of delivery of the child in Kansabel block after intervention of Jashpur ChildLine. 

Kansabel inspector Anita Prabhaminj said the survivor hails from Bataikela village and was taken to nearby forest by a local youth Ashish Kumar. "Ashish used to call his two friends Punedik Bhagat and Chandanram Vishwakarma and the three gang-raped her not once but multiple times. Their courage developed when the girl didn't complain to anyone. When the accused noticed a swollen belly, they stopped raping her," she said. 

Parents of minor girl had no clue of the incident nor did they report to police out of fear and ignorance. 

Prabhaminj said that it was difficult talking to the girl as she was shy and ignorant. "She seemed oblivious to the fact that what happened to her was wrong. Usually, tribal girls don't acknowledge they were being assaulted and assume it as a part of life. She doesn't really realize she's a mother now," the inspector said. 

Talking to TOI, Jashpur ChildLine coordinator Chavilal Sahu said, "Parents of girl were ashamed of bringing the matter to light even when we tried convincing them to lodge FIR. Now the girl will be presented before Child Welfare Committee after which she will be provided relief compensation, medical treatment and rehabilitation." 

Accused were arrested under Sections 376 (2G) of IPC, 3 & 4 of Protection of Child from Sexual Offences Act and tribal atrocities Act. Police said that the accused have confessed to the crime.
