			Rehana Banu, 45, of Juhapura, set herself on fire on Monday afternoon, in a bid to escape the harassment by two moneylenders, both women.
In her statement to the police, the woman, who survived the suicide bid, said that she had borrowed Rs. 15 lakh from the women lenders at 20% interest, and had invested the money in Abhay Gandhi's ponzi scheme.

Rehana banu Qureshi, resident of Yash complex, Juhapura, doused herself with kerosene and tried to kill herself with fire, but she was saved by neighbours.

The victim was later shifted to VS hospital, where her statement was recorded by Vejalpur police. The woman has suffered 30% burns. In her statement before the police, Qureshi stated that she was being constantly harassed by two women identified as Zarina Shaikh and Zahan shaikh of Jamalpur and Shah-e Alam areas, respectively, as she was unable to pay the rapidly mounting interest to them.
The police are yet to trace the accused persons.
