Description:
			In an incident of dowry-related killing in the city, a 15-year-old girl, Purnima Das, was allegedly burnt alive by her husband and in-laws. The victim's family alleged that she was burnt alive by her husband, Sunil Rabha, mother-in-law Sunita Rabha, and sister-in-law Puja Rabha on Thursday night.

Purnima, who was rushed to the hospital with almost 90 per cent burn injuries, succumbed to her injuries.

Basistha police station has registered a case against the accused under various sections of the law related to cruelty by husband or relatives. So far, police have arrested Sunita Rabha, while the prime accused, Sunil and Puja, are still absconding.

The incident occurred at the rented house of Sunil, located at Patarkuchi under Basistha PS.

"Purnima eloped with Sunil in September and got married to him. Soon after marriage, Sunil started asking her to give him Rs 25,000 to buy a motorcycle. She came to me asking for the money. But, my family was not in a financial condition to help her. She told us that Sunil had threatened to kill her if she could not get the money from us. She was very scared," said Sinta Das, the victim's mother, who lodged an FIR at the Basista PS.

Sunil and Purnima got married on September 20 and, according to neighbours, just a month later, Sunil started demanding money from her and assault her physically. "Sunil was a daily wager and has been jobless for some time. When we saw a fire in their house at around 9.30pm, we informed the police. Though we don't know what exactly happened, we suspect that Sunil and his family burnt Purnima alive," said a neighbour.
