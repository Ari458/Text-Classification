Rape
Description:
			A 25-year-old civil aspirant has accused a clerk in the Indian Air Force of allegedly raping her on the pretext of marriage in north Delhi's Mukherjee Nagar area.

The victim and the accused, identified as Ashutosh, met at an institute where they were preparing for civil services.

The woman in her complaint has alleged that they were in relationship since one year during which Ashutosh established physical relationship with her promising marriage.

"She says that they had even told their families about it and a certain amount was transferred to his account by her family as a pre-wedding gift.

"However, he had been avoiding her of late and his family was looking for some other girl for his marriage," said a police official associated with the investigation.

This irked the girl who then approached police.

"We have registered a case against the accused at Mukherjee Nagar Police Station and further investigations are on," he added.
