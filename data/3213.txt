Rape
Description:
			A court sentenced a 22-year-old youth to five years of rigorous imprisonment for trying to sexually assault his three-year-old niece, observng that his act was "most despicable" and he had "scant regard" for the safety of the minor.

Additional Sessions Judge Dharmesh Sharma also imposed a fine of Rs 5,000 on convict Rajesh Shah, a resident of Delhi, after holding him guilty under the provisions of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.

Shah was arrested for trying to sexually assault his niece on February 3 this year after he was caught by complainant Rahul Jain who heard the cries of the child when he was parking his car in Inderpuri.

February 3 this year, Shah had tried to sexually assault his niece and complainant Jain rescued the minor from the clutches of Shah and reported the matter to the police.

During the trial proceedings, the court did not record the minor's statement as she was unable to tell anything except her name.

Shah denied the allegations against him and claimed Jain had asked him to clean his car and when he refused to do so, the complainant falsely implicated him in the case.
