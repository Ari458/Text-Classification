Murder, Rape
Description:
			A day after the body of a 25-year-old woman was found in a drain southwest Delhi's Dadri, police said she was injected with poison by three men, including a Nigerian man, for resisting their attempt to rape her.

Cops said they came to know about the incident after they found another woman lying unconscious in a house in the same locality. Four people, including a woman, have been arrested.

Police said they received two PCR calls-one about the body and the other about a missing person from southwest Delhi on Sunday. "A team led by inspector Raj Kumar began a probe. One of the killers managed to escape to a neighbouring state," said R A Sanjeev, DCP, southwest.

The woman used to work in an event management company. One of her friends told cops that on Friday they had gone to a night club in south Delhi where they met the Nigerians who used to supply them drugs.

Police said that the women decided to accompany them to their house in Uttam Nagar and have another party during which the three men-Uche Chukwu Kalu, Durga Prasad and Gulshan-pulled her into another room and tried to rape her. When she resisted, Uche picked up a syringe and injected its content into her neck. The woman said that her friend collapsed after this. Uche then came to her and injected something into her hand as well after which she fell unconscious.
