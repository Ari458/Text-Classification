Rape
Description:
			A 57-year-old sub-inspector attached to the Airport police station has been booked for allegedly raping a woman (45) after promising her marriage. The Airport police on Saturday registered a case against the suspect under sections 376 (2) (rape by a police officer) and 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) of the Indian Penal Code. The complainant does not live with her husband. "The woman has a property dispute with her husband. In May, she had approached the Airport police station to lodge a complaint against him, where she met the suspect who promised to help her acquire the property," said a senior police officer. After some days, the suspect allegedly told the woman that his wife was dead and that he wanted to marry her. "He rented a room in Dighi for the woman and repeatedly raped her there," the officer said. The woman came to know that the suspect's wife was alive. "When she threatened to lodge a complaint against him, the suspect said he would divorce his wife and marry her," the officer said.
