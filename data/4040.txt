Child Sexual Abuse, Molestation, Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			A 35-year-old teacher of a private school was taken into custody for allegedly sexually harassing a minor girl student of the school after he was severely thrashed by the girl's parents and locals in the city.

The girl is studying Class IX in a private school in Urvasi Junction area of the city. This is the second such incident to rock the city within a week after a teacher at Kottapalem Government School was severely beaten up by members of a women's organization when he was trying to take advantage of a 10-year-old girl student. He was caught and thrashed by locals.

According to the police, 35-year-old A Bhaskar Rao (35) a mathematics teacher of the private school, and a resident of Kancharapalem Rythu Bazaar area, had been misbehaving with the student in school for the past few weeks. Though the girl complained to the school principal, the school management did not take any action against the teacher, the girl's parents alleged.

Irked with the school principal's attitude, the girl informed her parents, who along with locals manhandled the teacher. After learning about the incident through a Dial 100 phone call, Kancharapalem police rushed to the spot and took the teacher into custody.

The teacher was later sent to King George Hospital for treatment as he was badly injured in the attack by the locals.
