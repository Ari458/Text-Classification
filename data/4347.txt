Description:
			A 15-year-old girl has lodged a complaint with the Amraiwadi police accusing a youth of raping her and later assaulting her father and brother in Jashodanagar. Police are now hunting for the accused youth. Matters took a complicated turn when two women of the accused's family alleged that they had been stabbed by some family members of the complainant.

Geeta (name changed), 15, a resident of a chawl near KK Shastri Vidya Sankul in Khokhra, has stated in her complaint that she was abducted by her neighbour Michael Christian near Radhe Mall on at 2.30 pm. He took her to his relative's residence in Dehgam, where he allegedly raped her twice. Because of her protests, he took her back to the city.

Geeta's father had been searching for her. He came to know that Geeta was with Michael at Jashodanagar. When the two families met to discuss the matter at Jashodanagar, the situation turned violent. Geeta's father and brother confronted Michael. The duo alleged that the accused and his four friends beat them and injured them. After abusing them with caste-related slurs, they fled from the spot.

Christian's family members have alleged that the girl's family members stabbed them with knives in the same incident.

Christian's mother and another relative were injured and were admitted to LG Hospital.
