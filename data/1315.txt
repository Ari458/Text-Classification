Rape
Description:
			On February 10, 2012: Two teenaged schoolgirls were allegedly raped by at least 15 men in broad daylight in a deserted farm at Betna, near Indore.

A secret meeting that one of the girls had fixed up with one Javed sparked the ordeal that is bound to haunt them their entire life. Javed reportedly persuaded the girl to meet him, threatening to consume poison in front of her house if she failed to do so. Panicking, the girl decided to meet him at an isolated place, but took her cousin along. Javed and the girl then decided to go elsewhere for a chat, and as they were leaving, a gang of ten men intercepted them. The men dragged the hapless girls to a deserted field nearby where they took turns to rape the two. And Javed, who has since been arrested, too joined in the act.

Some men working in neighbouring fields landed up at the farm on hearing the commotion. And instead of rescuing the duo, they too allegedly raped them. 

According to the girls, some of the men also took pictures of the act on their mobiles and warned them not to the reveal anything.
