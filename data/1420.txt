Description:
			Jharna Bibi (21) of Pirpara village of Chori Anantapur under Kaliachak police station who was allegedly attacked with acid by her husband and in-laws on Sunday died in hospital on Monday.

The deceased married her neighbour Rajibul Sheikh, a labour contractor, two and a half years back. Rajibul used to torture Jharna and would ask her to fetch Rs 50,000 from her father, alleged Jharna's mother Roshnara Bibi. But as the family couldn't meet the demand, Rajibul and his family allegedly tortured Jharna.

The matter came to a head on Sunday when Rajibul started beating Jharna. "When Jharna tried to flee, Rajibul and his family members allegedly poured acid over Jharna and tried to set her on fire after showering her with kerosene," alleged Jharna's father Motiur Sheikh.
