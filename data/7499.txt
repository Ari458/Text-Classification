Description:
			Ghazipur police along with Women power line 1090 nabbed a 24-year-old man Rohit Raj for allegedly raping two sisters who were his neighbor for last five years.

Rohit Raj was arrested after one of the girls complained to the power line a few days. Police traced him and Rohit was booked under rape charges and POSCO act as one of the sisters was minor when she was raped the first time. The accused got in contact with the two sisters from Gorakhpur where the girls once lived during their father's job tenure and Rohit was their neighbor till 2009.

When the girls family moved to Lucknow a year ago, Rohit continued to harass and blackmail them. He first took the elder sister in confidence and raped her for over two years under the pretext of marrying her. Meanwhile, he trapped the younger sister too and shot a nude video of her to blackmail her into having relations with him.

The minor girl began to show signs of depression and anxiety. Two weeks ago when Rohit called the elder sister to his place she saw the explicit video of her younger sister on his cell phone. That is when she decided to file a complaint against Rohit and have him behind bars. She initially feared social stigma and hesitated but later with motivation from her friends filed a complaint with women's power line.

Police laid a trap and nabbed Rohit from Gudamba on Tuesday. When police checked his cell phone he had already deleted the video and pictures of both sisters. But with the help of cyber experts lost data of the phone was retrieved.
