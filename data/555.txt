Description:
			A 20-year-old man has been arrested for allegedly sodomising six boys at the Calangute village in Panaji over the past one-and-half years, police said on Monday.

According to police, the accused used to target school-going children, who were alone, after offering them lift on his two-wheeler.

"The accused would be on the lookout for victims who were usually not accompanied by their parents or guardians. His crime continued for almost one and half years," a senior police officer said.

The victims have alleged that D'Souza physically assaulted them if they resisted him.

The accused had allegedly also tried to rape two minor girls, an official said, adding that the victims managed to flee after raising an alarm.
