Abduction, Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A youth has been jailed for 10 years by a Delhi court for kidnapping and raping a minor girl living in his neighbourhood. The court sentenced 23-year-old Rakesh Kumar, a resident of Shahbad Dairy here, to rigorous jail term, and held that the 13-year-old victim's statement was clear, trustworthy, and inspired confidence.

There is nothing in her statement to suggest that she had any animus against the accused to falsely implicate him in the case,” Additional Sessions Judge Mahesh Chander Gupta said, and also imposed a fine of Rs. 40,000 on Rakesh.

The court observed, The sight cannot be lost of the fact that Indian women have tendency to conceal offence of sexual assault because it involves her prestige as well as prestige of her family. Only in a few cases, the girl or the family members have courage to go before the police and lodge a case.

According to the prosecution, on the morning of March 5, 2011, when the girl was going to her school in Metro Vihar , Rakesh asked her to accompany him.

He then took her to a secluded place and raped her.

When the girl did not return home, her father lodged a complaint at the Shahbad Dairy police station, and the next day, they found their daughter crying near their house. She narrated the incident to her parents and told them that Rakesh had raped her following which they took her to the police station, it said, adding that later the youth was arrested.

During the trial, Rakesh claimed innocence and said he was falsely implicated

The court, however, held him guilty of kidnapping, inducing the girl for illicit sexual intercourse, and raping the minor.
