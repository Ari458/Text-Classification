Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			A female research scholar who worked at the Gwalior-based Defence Research and Development Establishment (DRDE) has filed a complaint of "harassment" against a male scientist of the institution.

The woman pursued research under DRDE scientist Prabhat Garg in 2010-11, but left her job, after she got married and also because of the "uncomfortable" situation she faced at the hands of her male guide.

She suffered "harassment" in silence until her marriage because of her career, but when her male research guide did not spare her even after her marriage, she disclosed the matter to her husband.

The couple reached Gwalior and filed a complaint with the police, after which an FIR was registered in the case.

Later, police sent a notice to the scientist's residence, but since he was not at home, he has not responded to it so far.
