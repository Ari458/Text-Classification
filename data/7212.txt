Child Sexual Abuse, Crime, Rape
Description:
			The Child Welfare Committee (CWC) has lodged a complaint under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act with the Orleanpet police station against a 23-year-old youth for sexual abuse, causing pregnancy by rape and initiating termination of pregnancy which proved harmful to the 17-year-old victim’s life.

According to information available with the CWC, the victim, a minor girl, was in an affair with the accused, Thiyagarajan, 23, a resident of Velrampet. Mr. Thiyagarajan forced the victim into sex several times at his friend’s house.

When he learnt she was pregnant, he gave her tablets for abortion.

The girl was admitted to the Rajiv Gandhi Government Women and Children Hospital with severe blood loss due to the medication. The hospital authorities then informed the CWC, which investigated the matter. Though the families of the victim and accused reached a compromise, the CWC went ahead with the complaint.
