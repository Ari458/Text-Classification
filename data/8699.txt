Description:
			A 41-year-old man from Palghar district was recently sentenced to 10 years' rigorous imprisonment following his conviction by the Thane sessions court for raping a married tribal woman in 2014. Additional sessions judge S C Khalipe also imposed a fine of Rs 5,000 on the convicted man, Tatu Pawar.

Pawar had sexually assaulted the mother of three children at her home on November 10, 2014, when her family was out. Pawar entered her residence at midnight using the back entrance and raped her. He gagged her and said he would kill her, her in-laws and her husband if she told anyone about him, said the prosecution in court.

The court was also told that Pawar had raped the victim six months before as well. After she told her husband and father-in-law about that sexual assault, the villagers had issued a warning and the issue was set to rest.

The prosecution said that the victim and her family were illiterate and their complaint was not taken down by officials of the Mokhada police station, forcing them to approach the Dy SP (Vasai division).

The counsel for the accused argued that the victim's family and the accused had a dispute and that the victim's husband was a politician, but the judge dismissed these as irrelevant and unsubstantiated points.

"Considering all the evidence on record the court has come to the conclusion that the evidence of the victim and the witnesses is natural, trustworthy and believable," Khalipe said her order.
