Description:
			A 17-year-old girl was allegedly gang raped by four men in suburban Borivali.

Three of the four accused were arrested and were produced before a court, which has remanded them to police custody until December 2.

According to the police, the victim who is a school dropout from Uttar Pradesh, resided in Ganpath Patil Nagar slum in Borivali.

The girl, who lived alone in the house after her mother abandoned her, was being taken care of by her close male friend.

She left the house at about 8.30 pm to buy some food for herself, when she was allegedly intercepted by an auto-rickshaw driver Sonu Kamble, who was known to her.

Kamble dragged the girl into a mini tempo parked on Link Road. Later, he was joined by his two of his friends, Jaiprakash Pal and Aslam Khan, who are also auto rickshaw drivers.

The trio took turns and sexually assaulted her. Another person, who found something amiss in the tempo, reached there and he also raped the victim.

Hearing the girl's screams, a passerby caught Jaiprakash who was leaving the spot and handed him over to a cop patrolling the area.

The girl told the cops that she was raped by Jaiprakash Pal and three others.

A manhunt was launched for the accused after which Sonu and Aslam were apprehended, while the fourth accused is still at large.
