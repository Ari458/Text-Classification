Rape
Description:
			The accused had allegedly raped his 23-year-old handicap sister at his residence in Yerawada between December 3, 2011 and February 3, 2012. Police said the victim, afflicted by polio, made complaints about the alleged incident to her sister and mother. The victim's family members were reluctant to register a complaint against Papal and warned him to maintain distance from her. However, Papal refused to do so, and allegedly sought help from his wife to rape his sister on various occasions.
