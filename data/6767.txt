Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A Class XII student filed a police complaint accusing her father and uncle of repeatedly raping her over several years, following which the duo was arrested by the police on Friday.

An FIR was filed with the Sector 10 police station under sections of the IPC and Protection of Children Against Sexual Offences Act.

The survivor, a student of a private school in Gurgaon, called ChildLine's helpline 1098 on Thursday saying that her father, a government school teacher, and uncle, a manager of a private bank in the city, had been raping her. She sought help saying she could not take it anymore and was scared to stay at home.

According to the police, the girl was alone at home when her uncle first raped her in 2009, following which he assaulted her repeatedly. Initially, she kept it to herself but in 2011, she informed her parents.

While they told her that her uncle would not be visiting the house anymore, they warned the girl not to reveal the assault to anyone.

Then one day her father, in a drunken state, also raped her, according to the complainant.

"She claims in her complaint that her father allegedly raped her many times and her uncle had raped her over a period of three years. The two were arrested and sent to judicial custody on Friday," said Rajesh Kumar, ACP (crime), Gurgaon.
