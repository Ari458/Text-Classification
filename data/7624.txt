Child Sexual Abuse, Rape, Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			A 10-year-old girl was allegedly raped by her meditation teacher here but informed about it to her parents nearly a month after the offence, when she turned emotional while watching a television programme that showed an ordeal similar to hers, police said today. The minor girl was allegedly raped by the meditation teacher in his class on July 18 in Saraswati Nagar area of the city, but she did not disclose it to anyone out of fear and shock, Sub-Inspector Prakash Patel told PTI. 

But two days back, while watching a TV programme which depicted an ordeal similar to what she underwent, the girl broke down and informed her parents about it. Her parents later informed the Kotwali Police Station about the incident following which the teacher, identified as Mahesh Kowarne (33), was arrested, Patel said. Kowarne admitted to police that he had raped her, Patel said.
