Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A 17-year-old girl has filed a petition in the Madras High Court stating that she was sexually abused by senior police officials. A report in a leading daily says that the girl, who is motherless, was already being sexually abused by her grandfather and brother.

According to the petition filed by the teenage girl, she was allegedly taken by an South Zone inspector working and a sub-inspector to a hotel in Madurai. Senior police officers there reportedly sexually assaulted her.

The petition filed by the girl states, “Police officials operated like criminals and indulged in human trafficking. The girl was forced to live an agonisingly pathetic life filled with gang-rape, drugs and liquor.”

The girl has also filed a police complaint in all-woman police station in Sivaganga in June where post an investigation the girl’s character was maligned. 

The petition also said that even after the girl filed on June, a proper investigation was not carried out. The petition adds that the case wasn’t filed under Section 376 (rape), Section 370 (Exploitation of a trafficked person) and various sections of the POSCO Act which it should have been. It alleges that police officials are thwarting the case.

Advocate and social activist T Vincent has filed a PIL in this matter. It will come up for hearing on November 3.
