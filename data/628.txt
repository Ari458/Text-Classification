Rape
Description:
			Godghate had contacted Chandrapur-based 20-year-old Namrata (name changed) over the phone. He and Patil had brought the girl to the city after promising to marry her. The trio went to see films and also enjoyed food before the two youth took Namrata to a shanty near Shatabdi Nagar. Godghate had also informed his other accomplices about the girl. The accomplices came to the shanty and took turns forcing themselves upon her.

It was while returning to Chandrapur that the gang was caught with the girl in the early hours of the following day. Head constable Gautam Barhate, then posted at Ajni police station, had intercepted the car. Barhate had nabbed Godghate driving the car and a shivering Namrata in the vehicle.
