Crime
Description:
			A man tried to kill his wife and one-year-old son by pushing them off a hill in connivance with the woman he was allegedly in a relationship with, police said today.

The man who hails from Rohtas district of Bihar and his paramour who tried to commit the crime near Chandighat here yesterday have been arrested, police said.

Accused Dilip alias Kriparam Paswan worked as a labourer in a steel factory at Kotdwar in Pauri district.

He was allegedly in a relationship with a colleague named Sheila, who also worked in the same factory.

The accused took his wife Chandra and his one-year-old son first to the banks of the Ganga for an "outing" but as he did not get a chance to push them into the river there with too many people present, he took them to Chandidevi temple and pushed them off a hill in connivance with Sheila.

However, the mother-son duo got entangled in the bushes and were saved.

The accused then tried to kill them by strangulating them but his wife raised an alarm.

A crowd gathered there and the accused along with his paramour fled.

On the basis of a complaint lodged by the wife, later the accused was arrested along with Sheila, who hails from Bijnor district in Uttar Pradesh.
