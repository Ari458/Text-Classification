Description:
			A 17-year-old girl had been allegedly raped repeatedly for over a month by her boyfriend at Virar in the district and harassed by his parents, police said on Sunday.

20-year-old youth Ravi Vazvade, his father Raghunath and mother Tarabai Vazvade have been booked in the case, police sub inspector P R Gite of Virar Police Station said.

According to police, the victim was friends with Ravi as they studied together at a college in Mumbai's western parts. However, after the education she shifted to Aurangabad with her family.

"On June 14, the boy invited the girl to Mumbai. He went to receive her at Dadar railway station. He then took her to his aunt's house in Virar. The duo spent a few days there," Gite said.

When the parents of the boy came to know about it, they opposed it. They even went to Virar and threatened the girl saying that she should go back to Aurangabad and stop meeting their son, he said.

"However, since the victim had no money, she could not go back. In her complaint, the victim said that during her stay in Virar, she was repeatedly raped by Ravi under the assurance that he would marry her. She was subjected to physical and mental torture by the boys' parents," he said.

Finally, on July 29, Ravi's mother and another relative bought a train ticket for her and ensured that the girl returns to Aurangabad, they said.

On reaching Aurangabad, she filed a complaint with the police, which was forwarded to the Virar police for investigation.

While the boy has been booked under section 376 (rape) of the Indian Penal Code, sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace), 506 (criminal intimidation) have been invoked against his parents, besides the Protection of Children against Sexual Offences Act (POCSA), 2012, police said adding that no arrest has been made in the case so far.
