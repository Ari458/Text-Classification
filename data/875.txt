Street Harassment
Description:
			Two girls, who were preparing for IITJEE, were on way to their residence at Machua Toli after attending their coaching classes at Khajanchi Road at around 6pm. As they were walking, a youth riding a motorcycle first passed lewd comments on them. "The youth was so audacious that he caught the hand of one of the girls," Police said.

The girls raised an alarm drawing the attention of the locals. Some of the students of the coaching institute also reached there and thrashed Manish before the Police came to the spot. 

Brave of the girls to have raised an alarm. In many cases, this has resulted in a positive reaction from the crowd and people gathered nearby. When by standers notice such harassment and the girls do not complain, they assume that the victim is known to the harasser or it might be something personal and they dont interfere. But when the victim sends out a strong signal of protest by raising her voice, shouting, etc, the crowd reaction in most of the incidents reported has been positive.
