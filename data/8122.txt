Description:
			In a shocking incident, some unidentified persons on Saturday night sexually assaulted an old woman (65) in her residence at Vijayanagar Colony of Madanapalle town, and the incident came to light on Sunday.

According to the Madanapalle II-town police, the old woman was living alone at her house. The police said the woman was found to be talking to neighbours till 8 p.m. A few hours later, though the neighbours heard some commotion inside, they did not take it seriously. At around 8 a.m. on Sunday, a neighbouring woman called for the old woman and seeing that there was no response, she went inside along with others to find her lying unconscious and her dress torn, with bleeding injuries on private parts.

She was rushed to the Government Area Hospital, and was later shifted to SVRR Hospital at Tirupati, as her condition turned serious.

The police said that they were awaiting medical examination report. An official said two persons might have committed the crime. He said that the woman's younger son (38), married twice, and considered to be having psychological problems, will be taken into custody.
