Domestic Violence, Dowry Harassment
Description:
			Aam Aadmi Party candidate from Patel Nagar Assembly seat Hazari Lal Chahuan has been booked for dowry harassment after his daughter-in-law accused him and five other family members of torturing her.

The allegations have come at a time when the party is busy battling allegations of assault against Wazirpur candidate Rajesh Gupta. The complaint was submitted on December 30.

Mr. Chahuhans wife and all his four sons have been named as accused by his daughter-in-law Meenakshi Chauhan.

For the past three years he has been troubling her despite the fact that we never left any stone unturned in fulfilling the demands. There have been demands of money or other expensive articles, said a relative.

The victim married Mr. Chauhan's elder son in 2011.

From mental torture to physical harassment, I was subjected to everything. I did everything within my means to save my family life, which explains the delay in registration of the complaint, said Meenakshi, who also has a three-year-old son from the marriage.

The party said the timing of the complaint raised questions and appeared to be politically motivated.
