Abuse
Description:
			On Sunday, when parents are allowed to visit the private residential school in Purulia, the nine-year-old complained to her mother of abdominal pain.

When her mother questioned her repeatedly, the girl, a student of Class III, told her the teacher had been raping her since she had returned to school after the Puja holidays.

The father of a Class II girl, who is eight years old, also complained to the headmaster the same day about the same teacher's alleged sexual assault on his daughter.

There are 573 students in the co-educational private school. Of the 75 students who stay in the hostel, only 15 are girls.
