Rape
Description:
			A sessions court today convicted a 34-year-old man for raping wife of his friend for two years and awarded him imprisonment of seven years.

Sessions court judge A S Shende convicted Wilson D'Souza on charges of rape and criminal intimidation of IPC and under various sections of the Prevention of Atrocities against Scheduled Castes and Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.

According to the prosecution, D'Souza first raped the woman, a tribal, at her house in Aarey Colony, situated in Mumbai suburb of Goregaon (East), in September 2011 by spiking her tea when her husband was away.

D'Souza also shot video of the act on his mobile phone without knowledge of the victim, said public prosecutor Kalpana Hire.

"He went to the victim's house again after a month and sought sexual favours from her which she refused. However, D'souza showed her the clippings and threatened to upload them on social networking sites. The victim gave herself to the demands of D'souza fearing that her family's image will get tarnished," Hire said.

She finally confided in her husband in February 2013 and lodged a complaint against D'Souza, following which he was arrested.

Hire said the testimony of the victim bolstered the prosecution case. The prosecution also examined nine other witnesses during the trial.
