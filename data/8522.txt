Domestic Violence, Dowry Harassment
Description:
			A 27-year-old woman lawyer committed suicide by immolating herself at her parents place in Tirumangalam after her husband and in-laws allegedly demanded her to bring more dowry. Since she died within seven months of marriage, an RDO inquiry has been ordered.

The victim was identified as Seethalakshmi, 27, wife of Sanjay Priyan from PRC Colony in Thanakkankulam. She got married to Priyan in May, 2015. She had come to her parents' house situated in Keela Street in Kappalur after she was constantly harassed.

She took the extreme step on Wednesday, when her family members had gone out. Based on a complaint from the victim's brother Senthilnathan, a lawyer practising in the Tirumangalam court, police began an investigation.

In his complaint, Senthilnathan said that Priyan's sister Shalini Priyanka and her husband Vijay wanted to start a quarry business and were in need of Rs 3 lakh for initial investment. Priyan, his father and mother allegedly started demanding the money from Seethalakshmi who in turn asked her family members.

Senthilnathan used all his means like savings and borrowings and managed to collect Rs 2.5 lakh.

But Priyan's family was not willing to accept anything less than Rs 3 lakh. Meanwhile, they started torturing Seethalakshmi and even locked her up in a room.

Senthilnathan came to know about this, and brought his sister back to his house early this month. In the meantime, Priyan took steps to divorce her and sent a notice. Upset over this, Seethalakshmi committed suicide.

Superintendent of police Vijayendra Bidari said that although preliminary investigation revealed dowry angle, action will be taken only after the RDO inquiry report.
