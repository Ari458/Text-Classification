Crime, Dowry Harassment
Description:
			Police said Nandeesh from Gangavara had married Munivenkatamma, 19, recently. He allegedly began pestering her for dowry. Munivenkatamma came home for Gowri-Ganesha festival and refused to return alleging harassment by Nandeesh for dowry, said her father, Munivenkatappa, in his complaint. 

On Friday, when the family members had gone out for work, Nandeesh came to his in-laws house and persuaded Munivenkatamma to return home, the police said. After coming to know of it, Munivenkatappa rushed to Gangavara to see his daughter. But, Nandeesh feigned ignorance and refused to divulge whereabouts of Munivenkatamma. 

Munivenkatappa lodged a complaint with the Avalahalli police, accusing Nandeesh of kidnapping his daughter. During the interrogation, Nandeesh told the police that he strangled her and burnt the body to destroy evidence in a farm near Mandur. The police took him to the farm and retrieved the charred remains of the teenager.
