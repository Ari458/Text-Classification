Rape
Description:
			BJP leader and ex-Maharashtra MLA Madhu Chavan has been charged with raping a 50-year-old former party worker for the past 20 years after promising to marry her and transfer a flat in her name, police said today.

Chavan, a former President of BJP's Mumbai unit, dismissed the rape allegation as "absolutely false".

Quoting the complainant, Additional Police Commissioner Praveen Salunkhe told PTI, "The victim alleged that Chavan had raped her on several occasions since 1993. The duo got married in 2005 but it did not stand legal scrutiny." 

"The victim said Chavan promised her a flat but he never transferred the property in her name," Salunkhe said.

According to police, the former legislator and the victim met for the first time at a party programme in February 1993. They became friends and met frequently.

The complainant claimed she had been raped at different places, including at her residence in central Mumbai. Chavan told the victim he would marry her as he had strained relationship with his wife, they said.

The BJP leader has not been arrested yet and further probe was on, police added.

The 61-year-old politician rubbished the allegations levelled against him. "The allegations made against me are absolutely false. They (the complainant) want me to get out of politics," Chavan said.
