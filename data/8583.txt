Domestic Violence, Dowry Harassment
Description:
			The Ninth Additional District Magistrate ADJ Ch. Kishore Kumar on Tuesday sentenced four persons to 12 years of rigorous imprisonment and slapped a fine of Rs. 5,000 on each on charge of abetment of suicide of a housewife, who ended her life over dowry harassment at K.N. Peta under Anakapalle Rural Police Station limits in Visakhapatnam district in 2010. Police said Kavali Ramu married K. Seetha (20) and a few months after the marriage Ramu and his family members began harassing her for additional dowry. Unable to bear the continuous harassment from her husband and in-laws, Seetha committed suicide.

Seetha's parents lodged a complaint with the Anakapalle Rural police, who registered a case under IPC Sections 304 B and 498A.

After hearing the arguments from both sides, the court pronounced the judgment convicting the accused K. Ramu, K. Adhilakshmi, K. Kanakeswara Rao and K. Lakshmana Rao to 10 years rigorous imprisonment for abetment of suicide and two years of rigorous imprisonment for harassing the victim for dowry, which eventually led to her death.
