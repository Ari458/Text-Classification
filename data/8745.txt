Description:
			A student of a private engineering college in Puducherry was arrested on charges of creating a fake account in the name of a woman student at a government nursing college and posting her photos and making obscene remarks after she turned down his love proposal.

The arrested was identified as Vamshakrishna Yadav, a third year electronics and communication engineering student at a private college.

Police said the girl was known to Yadav as he is one of her brother's friends. Yadav, who befriended her while visiting her brother, started pressurising her to accept his love proposal. But she turned down his proposal and insisted him to stay away from her.

The spurned youth decided to take revenge on her. He created a fake account in her name on Facebook. He posted her picture and made obscene comments portraying her as a call girl. The girl, her parents and brothers were shocked when they learnt about the youth's action and approached police.

The woman lodged a complaint with the Grand Bazaar police on Sunday night.

A police team arrested him from his house at Muthialpet on Monday morning. The team produced him before a magistrate, who remanded him in judicial custody.

If convicted, the youth shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term, which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both. Conviction under the IT Act will also ensure punishment with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years with a fine.
