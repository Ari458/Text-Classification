Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			In yet another incident of child rape involving close relatives, the Kalpakancheri police arrested three persons on Saturday and are hunting for six more.

Two sisters aged 13 and 17 were found to have been repeatedly raped for months by nine persons at their house even when their parents were around. The role of their parents is being investigated.

Among the men who abused the children were their relatives, neighbours and father's friends. The accused raped the girls after getting their father drunk on most occasions. The incident came to light with the involvement of Childline officials after the girls' teachers complained of their frequent absence from school.

On counselling, the girls admitted that they had been abused for several months. An accused, Nibin Das, 28, from Parambilangadi near Kottakkal, had videographed the act and showed it to the sisters. A KSEB employee, Das had reportedly blackmailed the children with the video.

The children were rescued and produced in front of Child Welfare Committee member Haris Panchily on Saturday.
