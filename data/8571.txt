Human Trafficking
Description:
			A 45-year-old lady doctor and her husband were arrested in Madurai on Thursday for attempting to sell a 14-day-old baby. They were later remanded in judicial custody.

According to police, a minor girl from the Sivaganga district had approached the doctor, Shanti, to abort her baby. As the baby was more than eight months old in the womb, abortion could not be carried out. According to the doctor, the girl gave birth to the unwanted child but could not take him home with her. The doctor then decided to sell the infant.  

Police, with the help of the child protection unit, approached members of the racket posing as couples wanting to buy children and caught them red-handed. Attempts are on to trace the previous illegal activities of the doctor and her racket.

Earlier, four people belonging to the baby selling racket were arrested by the police on Wednesday. R Chitra Bai(63) of KK Nagar, who is the coordinator of an NGO, her brother R Prabahakaran, his wife Padmavathi (45) and their assistant M Kavitha (37) of Melur are the accused. Police are also investigating if the couple had sold any other babies in the past.
