Murder
Description:
			Policemen deployed at northeast Delhi's Khajoori Khas police station were in a for a shock here today when a 28-year-old man approached them and informed that he had murdered his wife two days back and her body was lying at home.

Based on Laxman Gupta's revelation, a police team rushed to the couple's rented accommodation in Prem Garden in West Karawal Nagar, broke open the door, and found the decomposed body of Suman Gupta (25) lying on the floor.

According to police, Laxman, who hails from Uttar Pradesh and worked at a nearby moulding factory, had married Suman four years ago. He claims that he was annoyed by his wife's constant nagging behaviour.

"The incident took place on Monday evening when during an argument Laxman lost his cool and strangled his wife to death.

He then locked the house from outside and went to a nearby railway station to commit suicide but could not do so," said a police official.

He spent the last night at a temple and then went to the police station this morning and confessed his crime, he said.

Suman's body has been sent for the post-mortem examination. Laxman has been arrested and booked for murder. A case has been registered at Khajoori Khas police station and their family has been informed, police said.
