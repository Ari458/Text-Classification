Dowry Harassment, Abuse
Description:
			The victim, Pooja Zhaveri was married to Rinkesh on May 25, 2010. She has alleged that her husband and his parents are using her weak eyesight as a pretext for demanding dowry from her parents. Pooja's eyesight, which was already weak, got even more affected after she suffered from dengue last year.

On February 24, Rinkesh and his family asked her to leave the house and said they wanted a divorce.

Talking to TOI, Pooja said, "I don't want divorce at any cost. I would like to go back and live with my husband and family. Had something happened to my husband's eyesight, would I have left him? Instead I would care for him better."
