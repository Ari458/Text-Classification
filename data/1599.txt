On Monday evening, Nand Kishore and Ram Deo accompanied by wives went to Ram Sumairin's house. Armed with sticks, rods and country made guns, they barged into the house looking for Ram Sumairin and his wife. When they did not find the couple, the Tiwaris assaulted Ram Sumairin's brother Badri Prasad who managed to flee.

The accused then dragged Badri's wife out of the house beat her with sticks and rods for about an hour while their wives allegedly tore off her clothes. They fled after the village pradhan's husband, Purshottam Rawat, rushed to the spot with a group of villagers.

Villagers clothed the woman and took her to a doctor. Her family members lodge an FIR at the local police station.
