Crime, Rape
Description:
			The Vasco police on Saturday rescued a 22-year-old woman student from Jamshedpur-Jharkand from the clutches of a Bihari man, Amarendra Raj Kumar, also 22, who was later arrested on charges of rape. 

The police said that Kumar, works as a cook in the port town, befriended the woman some months ago through a common friend. Promising to marry her, the youth brought her to his rented premises in Vasco. They came here on June 11. 

After a few days, things went sour and the youth began to rape the woman and there was no talk of marriage. Things turned worse and he would allegedly confine her to his room and lock it from outside. She was not allowed to use the phone until a few days ago when she narrated her story to her parents. The woman didn't even know the proper address of the place she was staying, but she mentioned about the hoarding of a bar, near the rented place, she could see from the room. 

On arriving in Goa, her shocked family members filed a complaint with the Vasco police on Saturday. Acting promptly, a team led by PSI Nikhil Palekar tracked the room in Shantinagar and found the woman confined in the room and rescued her. The Vasco police have arrested Kumar and registered a case under Section 376 (rape), Section 342 (wrongful confinement), Section 506 (II) (criminal intimidation) and Section 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) of the Indian Penal Code.
