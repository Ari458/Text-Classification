Murder, Crime
Description:
			A woman died and her friend suffered burns after some miscreants threw acid on them while they were travelling on a motorcycle on the national highway at Keesarapalli on the outskirts of Vijayawada on Friday night.

Reeling from shock after she was attacked, the woman fell off the bike and sustained grievous head injuries.

The victims were identified as P. Emaleyamma alias Rani (32) and K. Rajesh, natives of Telaprolu and Budhavaram, respectively, of Gannavaram mandal in Krishna district. They were rushed with serious burns to the Government General Hospital where Rani died in the early hours of Saturday while undergoing treatment.

According to police, the accused threw acid on the two while they were on their way to Unguturu mandal around 10.30 p.m. on Friday. Rajesh, who works with a private firm, is responding to treatment and is out of danger, doctors said.

The accused followed the couple on bikes and threw acid on them as they crossed Gudavalli village on the highway. Then they sped away, a villager said.

The Gannavaram police registered a case and took some suspects, including one Kiran, who had developed friendship with Rani, into custody. They are also verifying the call data in the mobile phones of the two.

Ranis body was shifted to the Government General Hospital mortuary for post-mortem, Gannavaram Circle Inspector Sk. Ahmed Ali said.

A case under Section 302 of the IPC [murder] has been registered. We have specific clues in the case, Mr. Ali added.
