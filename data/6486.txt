Murder
Description:
			A man was arrested for allegedly murdering his 42-year-old wife at Rangvamual near Aizawl today, the police said.

Khawsiamveli, who went to a nearby jungle to work with her husband Lalsiamliana on Friday morning had not returned home.

The neighbours, knowing that Khawsiamveli was not around in the village for two days asked the husband about her whereabouts but Lalsiamliana refused to provide any information except that they were drinking together in the jungle and might have passed out in an inebriated condition.

The neighbours then reported the matter to the nearby Vaivakawn Police Station resulting in the detention of the husband who reportedly confessed to the murder and informed the police about the location of Khawsiamveli's body.

The police and the local people found the body at around 10:30 AM today and the inquest report showed that she sustained several injuries on the head and back caused by blunt instrument.

Her body was taken to Lungleng village where her brother resides after the autopsy was performed.
