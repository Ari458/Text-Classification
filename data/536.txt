Description:
			Cops arrested her for thrusting a 14-year-old girl -- who lived next door to her -- into prostitution. The accused allegedly wanted to square accounts over Rs 15,000, which she thought the minor had stolen from her, police officials said. Police said that Mumtaz suspected that the victim, Sheena (name changed), had stolen cash and jewellery worth Rs 15,000 from her house a few months back. She had since been thirsting for reprisal. So one day, she spiked Sheena's drink and allegedly facilitated her rape. 

The sexual abuse continued for about four months, until one day, when Sheena had not returned home for 48 hours, her mother lodged a complaint with the police. Subsequently, Sheena was found, her tale of sexual exploitation revealed, and the accused nabbed.
