Description:
			A 25-year-old man has been arrested for raping a woman's 12-year-old sister and kidnapping her other sister's four-month-old baby after she spurned his advances. The accused, Monu Sachdeva, a Chembur resident and a hotel owner, knew Vinita (name changed to protect the victim's identity) since over four years when she started staying in the area. 

According to the police, on Monday night, when the two sisters were at the bar, Sachdeva went to their Nagpada home and took their sister and the baby out on the pretext of going for a drive. Meanwhile, the sisters approached us to report that their sibling and the child were missing after they could not find them on returning home, added Kadam.

They also found that he was the last person to call the minor girl, whose cell phone had been switched off since Monday night, after they sought call records from the mobile operator.

We have booked him for rape and kidnapping under sections 376 and 363 of the Indian Penal Code. He has been remanded in police custody till October 11, added Kadam.
