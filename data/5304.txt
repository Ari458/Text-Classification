			An 18-year-old girl was allegedly raped by two youths after they rendered her unconscious.

The girl lodged a complaint with the police today in which she claimed that the two youths Arun and Ranjit came to her house on Thursday and lied to her that her mother had called her to the fields where she was working.

As soon as she left the house, the two forcibly made her sit on one of their bikes and took her to a nearby place where they offered her a sedative-laced cold drink, it said.

On regaining consciousness, she found herself to be in a mall. She pleaded the two to drop her home, but instead they took her to an isolated place and raped her after rendering her unconscious by making her smell a handkerchief.

When she woke up, she found herself alone on the spot, police said, adding, a case has been registered against the two accused who are absconding.
