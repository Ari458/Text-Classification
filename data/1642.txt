Foeticide/Infanticide
Description:
			Police said Selvi (22) has been accused of feeding her less-than-a-month-old girl child with latex caltrop (erukam paal in Tamil), a typical method of carrying out infanticide in Dharmapuri. 

The child died on April 3 and was buried the same day near the house, amid rituals. Investigators said they would await forensic reports before describing it as a case of infanticide. 

The child's parents are being questioned. Initial inquiry revealed that Selvi resorted to this after a quarrel with her husband Selvam (29) over her having given birth to yet another girl child. 

They already have a four-year-old girl and the couple and family members claimed that the second child, also a girl, had died of illness a couple of years ago.
