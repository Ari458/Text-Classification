Molestation, Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			A lecturer of a fashion technology institution in Doddaballapur has been accused of sexually harassing and molesting a student on the college premises on January 24. The girl from Vogue Institute of Fashion Technology has also named a woman lecturer and a non-teaching staffer in her complaint.

Gourav Tyagi, who taught marketing to MBA students, his colleague Pooja Bakel and non-teaching staffer Chintan have been booked under IPC sections 506 (criminal intimidation), 504 (intentional insult), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty).

According to the complainant, her college bus driver did not deliberately pick her up on way to college on January 24. Her father dropped her at the college in his car. He was talking to the principal about the driver's negligence when Pooja entered the chamber and said the driver did not pick her up as she was irregular.

The girl's father demanded that he be shown his ward's attendance. When she tried to reason it out with Pooja, Gourav barged into the chamber and abused her and her father. When the girl's father resisted, Gourav punched him on his face. She tried to protect her father and Gourav sexually assaulted her.

However, the college management refuted the girl's allegations. MM Kariappa, MD, Vogue Institute of Fashion Technology, said the girl's father abused Pooja and Gourav who only tried to pacify him. They had revised the bus timings recently and that may be why the girl missed the bus.

Police have received oral complaints against Gourav Tyagi from girl students. But there were no written complaints.
