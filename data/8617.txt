Child Sexual Abuse, Rape, Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			A special court on Wednesday convicted and sentenced a man to five years imprisonment for sexually assaulting a minor who was left in his sister-in-law's day care centre during the day.

The 2013 incident came to light a few days after the child refused to go to the baby sitter's house and suffered from fever. On taking the child to the gynaecologist the mother was informed that it could be a police case. She prodded the child to who finally confided in her about the assault.

A complaint was then lodged with the Versova police station. The child's statement was recorded and the accused was nabbed. The child was six years old at the time of the incident and had an elder sibling who was in college.
