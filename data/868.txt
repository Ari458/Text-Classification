Dowry Harassment
Description:
			The demands for dowry started immediately after the engagement ceremony, two days before the wedding. The groom, Jayesh Khilnani (28), an executive in a financial company in Singapore, told the police that he was not involved in the dowry demand and had agreed to the marriage as he liked the girl. The police have arrested Jayesh, while his mother is wanted in the case.

The Khilnani family threatened to call off the marriage at the last moment if their demands for more jewellery and lavish reception for the guests were not fulfilled after which the girl, in a show of courage, came forward to cancel the marriage and file the police complaint," said an officer.
