Rape
Description:
			A man has been sentenced by a Delhi court to two years in jail for molesting his five-year-old daughter. The court said “the saviour had acted as the destroyer”.

“A father, who is required to protect his daughter, cast his lustful eyes on the minor daughter, aged five years, and committed rape upon her, which is one of the most extreme forms of child abuse and results in serious and long-term psychological trauma,” the court said.

According to the prosecution, the North-East Delhi resident had raped his daughter several times in June 2010 after his wife left for her parents’ house following a fight between them.

“In the instant case, a biological father has outraged the modesty of his own little daughter ,aged five years. A saviour has acted as a destroyer,” the Judge said.
