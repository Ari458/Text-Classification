Murder
Description:
			A mother-son duo have been sentenced to life imprisonment by a local court in a case of honour killing here.

District Magistrate Kaushalendra Yadav yesterday sentenced Pushpa and her son Dinesh to life imprisonment after they were found guilty of murder.

On September 21, 2013, Gajendra, a resident of Shivshakti had registered a case alleging that his daughter Laxmi was murdered by goons.

Investigations, however, found that the Laxmi was involved in a relationship with a boy in the village. Upset over the relationship, her mother and brother strangulated her to death with a rope.

The court has also imposed a fine of Rs 10,000 each on the duo.
