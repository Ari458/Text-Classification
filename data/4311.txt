Abduction, Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A minor tribal girl was severely injured after she was abducted and gang-raped by five people at an isolated house in the forests of Kansabel block in Jashpur district.

Crime in Jashpur refuses to curb as incidents of abduction, rape and human trafficking continue to take their toll.

The survivor was walking back to her home in Gheghra from a weekly market along with her brother when five youths who had been stalking her for a few days, interrupted them. The accused attacked the girl's brother and pushed him in a ditch after beating him.

The girl was then abducted and dragged to an isolated house in the forest where the accused gang-raped and left her bleeding and injured. The condition of the girl was stated to be stable but she had sustained severe injuries.

The survivor's younger brother somehow managed to reach back home where he narrated the incident to his family and police after which girl was rescued from the spot.

The girl has identified all five accused they hail from nearby village.

Accused Chakku, Shyam, Munna, Kenal and Chotu are at large and police have registered a case of abduction and rape against them and are looking for them. 

Although Jashpur district has a better record in girls' education compared to other tribal districts in Chhattisgarh, it stands among the top in crime against women with frequent cases of rape and trafficking. While locals blame it on the laidback attitude of police, officials pas the buck over to the citizens saying that these issues have been existing since ages and are not really a major concern for people.
