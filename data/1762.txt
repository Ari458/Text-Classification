Crime, Dowry Harassment, Abuse
Description:
			In yet another year when crime against women has been high in Andhra Pradesh, the most noticeable rise has been in the frequency of cases of abetment to suicide against husbands or in-laws. According to figures from the State Crime Records Bureau of the CID, the frequency of dowry-related murders has remained roughly the same.

From January 1 to June 30 this year, 708 cases of abetment to suicide 118 a month have been registered across the state against husbands and in-laws. In 2011, such cases numbered 1,287 for the entire year, or 107 a month.

This year's 708 cases are over and above the 376 dowry murders and deaths that occurred in that six-month period. That is more than 1,000 cases related to either dowry or harassment for one reason or the other, says AP Mahila Sangham's P A Devi.

The previous year had seen 761 dowry-related deaths and murders in 12 months; the current frequency is lower by about one case every month. Overall, 15,610 various cases of crime against women were registered across the state in the first half of this year.

A number of harassment-related incidents have had techies involved. On July 31, 25-year-old Dipti Chary hanged herself at her house near Madhapur in Hyderabad. She was married to Visarupa Chary, a software engineer. Her parents lodged a complaint against him for harassing their daughter for additional dowry.

Hyderabad City and Cyberabad, the IT hub, logged the highest number of harassment cases, 755 and 870 respectively, during the first six months of 2012.
