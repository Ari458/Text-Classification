Description:
			A student of a DU college has accused a visually-impaired professor of sexually harassing her and sending indecent messages following which an FIR has been registered against him.

The student of Aditi Mahavidyalaya, which is situated in the Bawana area here, had approached the principal of the college alleging that the professor had molested her after calling her on the pretext of "special classes".

She also claimed that he sent her indecent messages and videos on WhatsApp and harassed her by making phone calls at odd hours.

The girl further alleged that the principal did not take note of her complaint and said it was then that she had decided to approach police.

However, the principal, Mamata Sharma, rubbished the allegations even as she said that the matter has been referred to the college's Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) and due action would be taken on the basis of the probe report.

"The professor has been booked for sexual harassment under Sections 354 and 509 (outraging the modesty of a woman and usage of words, gestures, etc. intended to outrage the modesty of a woman) of IPC," a senior police official said.

The accused, a contractual faculty member of the Social Works Department of the college, did not respond to calls and text messages seeking his comments on the issue.
