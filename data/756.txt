Dowry Harassment
Description:
			Jugal Kishore, belonging to Delhi, was to marry Sonu. As soon as the ritual of seven rounds of the fire was to begin, the father-son duo demanding money for a flat in Delhi and a car as dowry. Jugal Kishore threatened to leave without marrying the girl. Instead of bowing to the dowry demand, the family members informed the police.
