Description:
			A 20-year-old final year engineering student who boarded a crowded train at Virar on Tuesday was beaten up by a group of women commuters who objected to those alighting at Vasai getting onto trains for Churchgate instead of nearer destinations like Borivli. Rutuja Naik, a student of Vidyavardni College of Engineering and Technology, Vasai, suffered a brief asthmatic attack during the chaos. Her hair and T-shirt were pulled while she was being roughed up.

The student boarded the 8.40am Virar-Churchgate train from platform No. 2 at Virar, the originating station. She barely managed to get into the second class ladies coach when a group of women seated inside began passing remarks that commuters wanting to alight at Vasai should board Borivli-, Andheri- and Bandra-bound trains. The women argued that commuters alighting at Vasai block the footboard, making it difficult for Nalasopara commuters to get in. Nalasopara is after Virar.

Vasai GRP inspector Mahesh Bagwe said a non-cognisable offence has been filed against unidentified women. Rutuja said she can identify the women. On Wednesday, she reached Virar station at 8.10am to identify the women, who are regulars, but got stuck in formalities and the train left.

On Tuesday, as Rutuja was readying to alight at Vasai, four seated women two in their 20s and two in their early 50s tried to pull her inside the seating area. They prevented her from getting out to "teach her a lesson", the police said. Rutuja said the women also punched her and scratched her on the wrist. She managed to get out after three or four women commuters alighting there pulled her out.

Rutuja said the accused are most probably residents of Nalasopara. They board trains there, travel to Virar, get seats and travel back to Churchgate.
