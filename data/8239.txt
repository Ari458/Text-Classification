Description:
			In yet another incident of harassment of tourists here, a female visitor from Russia was allegedly manhandled by three drunk youths at Akbar's Tomb in Sikandra on Tuesday. Staff from the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) handed the youths over to the police, who arrested them under section 151 (to prevent the commission of cognizable offences) of CrPC and presented them before a court on Wednesday, which further remanded them for questioning.

Cases of harassment of tourists continue at Agra monuments, the most visited in the country, despite measures announced by the Centre and state authorities. A senior ASI official said a group of tourists including this Russian woman had come to the monument around 4.30pm. "The youths, identified as Abhay Chaudhary, Vivek Kumar and Rinku Chaudhary, all residents of Gonda in Aligarh, harassed her and insisted she get a picture taken with them. When she refused, one of the men caught hold of her hand. They were seemingly drunk," he added.

The guide who was accompanying the tourist group approached staff at the ticket counter and subsequently police was called, the official added. Police brought the tourist and the three men to the police station. The woman refused to file any report in the matter and asked cops to warn the men not to repeat the act in future. "Even though the woman did not file any complaint, we arrested the three men under section 151 of CrPC and produced them in court," said Hari Parwat circle officer Salman Taj, talking to TOI.
