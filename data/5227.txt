Description:
			A minor girl was kidnapped from outside her home and raped in a moving car by her neighbour and two of his friends, police said on Saturday. The three accused have been arrested.

The incident occurred on Friday afternoon in Mukundpur area of north Delhi.

The three men - Satish Sisodiya, Sanjay and Giju - were arrested hours later after some residents noted the number of the car in which the crime took place.

Police said that on the day of the incident, Sisodiya called the girl - said to be around 13-14 years - on her mobile phone and asked her to meet him outside her home. He threatened to hurt her family members if she refused.

"As soon as the girl stepped out, the three accused pulled her into the car and sped away. But some locals noted down the number and informed us," a police officer said.

The girl was then raped by the three men in the moving car owned by Sisodiya.

"Medical test has confirmed rape. We have registered a case against the three and have impounded the car," said the officer.
