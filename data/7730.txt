Description:
			A 17-year-old girl was molested, and her mother thrashed on Saturday near Kurali by a man identified as Baljinder Singh, a Kurali resident. As per the girl's statement to the police, Baljinder has been stalking her for the past three months whenever she went out of her house. She had told her parents about it, but no written complaint was filed with the police.
