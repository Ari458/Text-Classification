Description:
			

Ajit had taken his wife Purnima Pramanik to watch a baul performance. He later killed her with a razor. Several villagers who had seen Ajit and Purnima at the event were astonished to find him returning from Panutia alone on his bicycle. Babon was then 17 years old.

Babon speaks up: 

"I am happy with this judgement as my father had brutally murdered my mother. He used to torture her regularly. I did not hesitate to use this as evidence against my father as I wanted to do justice to my mother."
