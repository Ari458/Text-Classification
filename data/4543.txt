Rape
Description:
			A 21-one-year-old housewife was allegedly gang-raped by her husband's friends in Mumbra after they spiked her soft drink. The men, identified as Praveen Mishra, 21 and Bunty Varma, 24, have been arrested by the police. They are contract labourers.

Police sub-inspector PV Chavan from Mumbra police station said: "We have arrested the accused and will soon send them for a medical test." The accused have been charged under section 376 (rape), 328 (causing hurt by means of poison, etc.) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code.

The incident happened when the victim was alone at her home. Around 5pm, the accused came and asked her about her husband. When she told them that he would return late from work, they asked her for some money to buy alcohol. Since they were her husband's friends, she gave them Rs200.

The duo went to the market and got back to her house. Along with alcohol, they also bought some soft drink. They offered her some spiked soft drink and allegedly raped her. After the incident, they even beat up the victim and threatened to kill her if she revealed about it to anyone. Later, the duo allegedly robbed Rs5,000 from her and left from her place.

She narrated the incident to her husband when he came back. They then approached the Mumbra police. Taking immediate action, the police nabbed the duo.

"We have recovered the money the accused had robbed from the victim. The duo will be produced in court tomorrow," said a police officer.
