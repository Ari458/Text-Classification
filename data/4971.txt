Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A 46-year-old man has been arrested for allegedly raping his 17-year-old stepdaughter repeatedly in Goregaon (east) behind his wife's back. Incidentally, the victim did not get support from her own mother when she broke down and told her about the incident. So the minor rape victim mustered the courage and approached the police herself.
According to the Aarey sub police, the accused (name withheld to protect the victim's identity) is a plumber and works in a government hospital. The victim's mother comes from a poor family and had married the accused after he promised to take care of her two daughters, including the victim and another five-year-old.
They live in a slum in the Aarey colony area. The crime occurred last month between May 26 and June 19, when the victim's mother had gone to her village. The mother took the younger daughter along with her, leaving the victim alone with the man.
As per the victim's statement, the accused raped her on two to three occasions. She confided in her mother when she came back, but the mother could not make a firm decision, as the family was solely dependent on the accused for their needs. The victim's mother further told her that it will stigmatise them in the society and once her stepfather goes to jail, it would worsen their economic conditions. But the victim couldn't take the torture anymore.
She approached the police station on Friday and was sent for a medical test. The accused has been arrested under Section 376 (rape) of Indian Penal Code and under relevant Sections of the Protection of Children From Sexual Offences Act. He was produced before the magistrate's court and sent to police custody for further probe, said senior police inspector Vilas Chavan of Aarey sub police station.
