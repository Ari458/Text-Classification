Description:
			Baby Shireen, her tiny hands in casts, her body burnt with cigarettes, is trying to recover. She was released from a local hospital on Monday evening.  

Shireen's mother, Zarina, has just re-united with her husband and the father of her three children. Months ago, she had eloped to Ajmer with a man named Wahid, taking her children with her.  Wahid tortured Shireen and her brother Imran; their sister Gulab was spared. When Wahid forced Zarina into prostitution a few weeks ago, she decided she had to leave him.  She managed to escape from Ajmer and returned to Indore, where she took her children to hospital for help.

"He (Wahid) used to beat my daughter in my absence. He also broke her to arms. I thought the swelling could have been because of minor beatings, I didn't know the baby's arms were broken. One day when I went out for work, he rubbed beedi (cigarette) buds into my baby's body," Zarina told NDTV.
