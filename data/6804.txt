Dowry Harassment
Description:
			Unable to bear constant harassment by her husband and in-laws for additional dowry, a woman reportedly committed suicide by hanging herself from a fan at her residence in Drivers Colony near Gajuwaka here Monday evening. The deceased was identified as Chandrakala (23), a native of Vizianagaram.

Gajuwaka circle inspector M Appa Rao said that Chandrakalas father Sammangi Appa Rao married her off to one Santosh Kumar from Drivers Colony in the city on March 9, 2014. He gave Rs 6 lakh and few household articles towards dowry at the time of the wedding.

However, Chandrakalas husband and in-laws had been harassing her for an additional dowry of Rs 2 lakh.

On Monday evening, Chandrakalas father received a phone call from Santosh Kumar stating that his daughter committed suicide.

Appa Rao immediately alerted the police who rushed to the spot and found a suicide note stating that she was resorting to the extreme step as she was unable to bear the torture of her husband and in-laws. The cops shifted the body to government hospital for post-mortem.

Based on Appa Raos complaint, the police took Santosh Kumar and his family members into custody Tuesday morning and are investigating.
