The two accused, Shyam Kumar and Bhim Yadav, have been arrested and the car has been seized. It is the third such case of crime against women in the district within seven days.

The incident surfaced a day after HT reported that a woman in state capital Ranchi had asked journalists if she had done anything wrong by killing man, who had raped her minor daughter.

The Ramgarh girl, a Class 7 student, was returning home after attending an annual function at her school when she was allegedly abducted, assaulted and released a day later. Threatened with dire consequences, she was asked not to speak up.
