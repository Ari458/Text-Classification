Murder, Crime
Description:
			When the woman's husband came to the house, he saw the victims lying in a pool of blood and he reported the matter at Bindapur police station.

The prosecutor argued that the two men had killed the three victims in order to rob valuable articles and the murders were committed in a pre-planned manner.

During the trial, the duo had claimed innocence but they failed to offer any explanation to the evidence against them.

While convicting the duo for murder and robbery with an attempt to cause death, the court said that in view of the impeccable testimonies of the prosecution witnesses, the chain of circumstantial evidence was complete and the two men were the perpetrator of crime.
