Abuse
Description:
			The constable and his friend forcibly confined a woman from Odisha to a car, after she sought lift for reaching her house in 2010.   The court observed that the woman, a resident of Odisha, had trusted the constable to help her reach home, but he took advantage of her weakness.   

On May 23, 2010, evening, Manoj Kumar asked the woman to sit in a car on the pretext to dropping her home.   "Instead of dropping her near her residence, Manoj on false pretext of driving her to her house kept her locked inside the car. She was dropped near her residence at 3 a.m. the next day," said the victim's complaint, alleging that the constable outraged her modesty.
