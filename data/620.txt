In a fit of rage, he poured kerosene over Sadhna and set her on fire. Seeing his wife engulfed by flames, Sunil panicked, and began to run. Sadhna followed him for a short distance, but then collapsed,"

Sunil had even stopped contributing from his salary for household expenses. To make ends meet, his wife would have to work as a domestic help. Uncomfortable with his wife stepping out of the house every day, Sunil would doubt her fidelity, and would physically abuse her, on a regular basis.
