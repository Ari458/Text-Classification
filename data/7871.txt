Dowry Harassment
Description:
			Mangathalli, 25, committed suicide by hanging herself to the ceiling fan at her home in Gudipa village of Ravikamatham mandal in Visakhapatnam district on Thursday night.

She married P. Sattibabu two years ago after his first wife had divorced him.

Quoting neighbours, ASP of Narsipatnam S. Yesubabu said that the marriage had been in trouble since beginning as the deceased was allegedly being harassed for dowry by her husband.

We are awaiting the post mortem report. For now, we have booked a case under dowry death and abetment to suicide, said Mr. Yesubabu.
