Description:
			A 21-year-old woman from Sikkim working with an NGO based in south Delhi was allegedly raped by the owner and an employee of the organisation for nearly a year. The accused have been arrested.

The matter came to light after the woman approached the Delhi Commission for Women and lodged a complaint at Hauz Khas police station.

The woman said she came to Delhi a year ago and joined the NGO as a fund-raising agent. She complained that the incident occurred when once she went to the house of Krishna Adhikary, the owner of the NGO, for an official work. He locked her in a room and forced himself on her. Later, he and another employee, Manoj Kumar, allegedly repeatedly raped her on several occasions.

The duo had allegedly recorded the act and threatened to upload it on a social networking website if she revealed the matter to anyone.
The woman managed to quit the job in December. However, they continued to threaten her.

Earlier this week, the woman got in touch with DCW who informed the Delhi Police. The woman's statement was recorded before a court under the Section 164 of the CrPC on Friday.

Police said Adhikary admitted to having committed the crime. A case of rape under Section 376 of the IPC was registered against him and he was sent to a 14-day judicial custody.
