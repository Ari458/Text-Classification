Description:
			Three men have been sentenced to 10 years rigorous imprisonment by a Delhi court for gang-raping and kidnapping a 14-year-old girl from outside her school.

Additional Sessions Judge M C Gupta sent Delhi residents Narender, Tek Ram and Vikram to jail after holding them guilty for the offences of gang-rape, kidnapping and abducting the girl to compel her for marriage.

The court also imposed a fine of Rs 40,000 each on 30-year-old Narender, 24-year-old Ram and 22-year-old Vikram.

The court said it has been proved that the three men had kidnapped the minor on the afternoon of January 15, 2010, from outside a school by forcibly making her sit on a motorcycle.

The trio then took the girl to a house in Narela and locked her there, it said, adding that while Ram and Vikram raped the girl, Narender remained outside guarding the room.

"I am of the considered opinion that the ends of justice can be met by sentencing convicts Vikram, Tek Ram and Narender to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of 10 years each under section 376(2)(g) (gangrape) of IPC," the judge said.

A case was lodged by the girl's parents at Narela police station in north west Delhi on January 16, 2010 alleging that Ram who was known to the victim met her outside her school and took her away on his motorcycle.

Narender and Vikram were following them on another bike and they took her to a room and raped her. Thereafter, Ram dropped the girl near her house.

During the trial, the three men claimed innocence saying they were falsely implicated in the case.
Seeking leniency, Vikram said he was a driver and has to support his family and claimed that his younger brother was a national level boxing champion.

Ram, who was working at a mobile repairing shop, and Narender, a conductor with DTC, also sought a lenient view saying they were not previous convicts and had cooperated during the trial.
