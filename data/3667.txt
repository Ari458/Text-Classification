Murder
Description:
			A 30-year-old woman was allegedly murdered and her body set on fire by unknown people in Zafrabad of North-East Delhi in the wee hours.

The incident came to light at around 1:30 AM when locals saw flames near a parked car in Arvind Nagar near the house of a former BJP MP.

As the locals doused the fire, they saw a woman's body after which police was informed. Police rushed the victim to nearby Guru Teg Bahadur (GTB) hospital where doctors pronounced her brought dead with more than 90 per cent burn injuries.

The body has been preserved for the postmortem.

The identity of the woman, who was charred beyond recognition, has not been established yet.

The woman seems to be around 30-year-old and an FSL team lifted forensic evidence from the spot.

Police are suspecting that her murderers killed her somewhere else, brought her body here and set it on fire in order to destroy evidence and her identity. They did not find anything from the deceased. They have informed police from surrounding areas to establish her identity.
