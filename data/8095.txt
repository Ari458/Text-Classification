Description:
			A 16-year-old girl was allegedly molested and beaten up by a group of youths when she protested against one of them making objectionable gestures at her. The incident was reported from east Delhi's Khichripur on Tuesday afternoon.

The girl was admitted to a hospital where she was diagnosed with internal injuries. A case under POCSO and physical assault has been registered against the youths on a complaint by the girl's family.

The family said she had left home to dump garbage at a dhalao when the youths made the objectionable gesture. When she protested, one of the youths groped her from behind. The girl then raised an alarm and tried to inform her family, but the youths pushed her to the ground and allegedly punched her.

Hearing her calls for help, the family members rushed out of the house but the youths fled the spot. They identified one of them as Ankit who has been harassing the girl for the past few days. The family later went to Mayur Vihar police station and registered a complaint.

Police are trying to identify the other accused from CCTV footage recovered from the area. The sequence of events is also being established. The girl's statement has also been recorded under sections of CrPC.
