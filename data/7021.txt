Abduction, Rape
Description:
			A 30-year-old woman has alleged that she was gang-raped in a village near Gwalior on Monday night. The government railway police (GRP) at Vadodara railway station registered a complaint late on Tuesday night when the woman was admitted to SSG Hospital. The survivor was taken to the hospital by 181 Abhayam that got an emergency call.

Police said that the survivor, a mother of four children, is a resident of a village near Gwalior in Madhya Pradesh and was travelling in Jhansi-Bandra Express. "She told us that she was kidnapped by three unidentified persons when she was sleeping at her home on Monday. The trio took her to a field nearby and took turns to rape her. She also said that the trio also intoxicated her while committing the crime. The woman doesn't remember what happened later," said inspector K D Rathod of GRP. The survivor told the police that she faintly remembers being taken to railway station and abandoned in the train.

"Some of the passengers on the train noticed that she was in pain and called up the emergency services in Godhra but by then the train had left the station. So, we reached Vadodara railway station where the train has a stop," said an Abhayam official. He added that she was very disturbed and was crying.

Sources in SSG said that her medical examination has confirmed that she was raped. Rathod said the case will be forwarded to Gwalior. "The spot where the crime happened falls under the jurisdiction of Indragunj police station in Gwalior. We will send her to Gwalior with police security," Rathod said.
