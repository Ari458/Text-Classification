Description:
			A 35-year-old woman's husband and in-laws allegedly tied her to a tree and set her ablaze in Chindwara district of Madhya Pradesh over dowry. 

Tabassum died at a hospital in Nagpur on Wednesday days after she was burnt on August 18. She was married seven years ago and had two children. 

Tabassum's father, Gafur Khan, alleged police initially refused to lodge a complaint against her husband and in-laws. 

SP Purshotam Sharma told TOI that team was dispatched to Nagpur to collect her autopsy report and copy of dying declaration. 

SHO R K Gupta said investigations were on. He said Tabassum's husband, a fruit vendor, was being questioned. 

"Action will be taken on basis of the autopsy report," he said. Police initially suspected Tabassum attempted suicide, troubled over dispute with her mother-in-law. 

Police launched investigation only after her parents called the newly launched CM helpline 181.
