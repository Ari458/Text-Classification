Description:
			A 38-year-old man from Hari Nagar village killed his father on Thursday for making sexual advances towards his wife while he was away. 

According to reports, 60-year-old Baiznath entered the room of his daughter-in-law, who was sleeping with her four children, while his son Jitendra Kumar was at the fields and made sexual advances at her. 

When she refused, the old man reportedly abused her and went back to sleep in the courtyard, said cops. 

When Kumar returned home in the morning, his wife, Bitanashree Devi, told him about the incident. This led to heated arguments between the two men. 

Cops said that instead of apologizing, Baiznath abused his son and hit him with a bamboo stick. Angry over the incident, Kumar reportedly attacked his father with a spade, the impact of which killed him on the spot. 

Thereafter, Kumar fled from the village and took the murder weapon with him. 

Police said that after Kumar fled, his wife and children raised an alarm and villagers gathered at the house. Kumar's 14-year-old daughter gave an official statement against her father. 

"A case has been lodged against the accused under section 302 (murder) of Indian Penal Code (IPC). We will arrest him soon," said Shakti Singh Tomar, station officer, Jalalabad police station.
