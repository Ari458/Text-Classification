Description:
			The girl had gone to fetch water from a roadside tap. She was standing in the queue when Chottu, the youth, allegedly teased her. She shouted at him and told him to behave himself, but Chottu persisted. Several others were standing in the queue, but none of them spoke up. This bolstered Chottu's courage and he allegedly proposed marriage to the girl. Thinking she had had enough, the girl asked him to leave at once, but at that Chottu allegedly whipped out a knife and stabbed her repeatedly. As the knife struck her in the shoulder, hands and back, the girl started screaming in a desperate bid to get help.
