Description:
			The woman, a 25-year-old housewife from Kurar, Malad (East), was in a state of hysteria at the time of being rescued. Her eight-year-old son was strapped to her stomach with her dupatta (shawl). She alleged that she had been beaten up by her husband and father-in-law and virtually thrown out of the house. Miserable and with nowhere to go, she decided to end her and her son's life.
