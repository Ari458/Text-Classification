Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			A 36-year-old kitchen attendant at the National Institute for the Visually Handicapped (NIVH) was allegedly molested by the in-charge of the department, inside the campus in Bon Hooghly, BT Road. 

SS Chauhan had assumed office as the head of NIVH on May 10. On May 29, around 1.30 pm he asked the lady kitchen attendant for a glass of sherbet. The place was nearly empty as it was lunch time. As I placed the glass on his table and was about to leave, he asked me to wait and suddenly held me tightly, groped me and started kissing me. I tried to stop him but he wouldn't listen till there was a sound outside the cabin. Before I could run out, he threatened me that if I talked about the incident, I would lose my job, said the victim, who is a widow and is a casual employee of the department.
