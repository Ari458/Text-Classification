Description:
			The dust on the suicide of architecture student Rishiteswari has not settled yet and Acharya Nagarjuna University (ANU) was rocked again on Thursday with another girl alleging harassment from a senior student. The accused, B Balaiah, was taken into custody and a case slapped against him. 

Police quoted the first year PG botany student as saying that Balaiah has been harassing her for several weeks. The victim initially complained to ANU authorities, but their apathy forced her to approach Pedakakani police on Thursday. However, ANU in-charge VC B Udayalakshmi said that they suspended Balaiah soon after receiving the complaint.
