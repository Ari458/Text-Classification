Domestic Violence, Dowry Harassment, Other
Description:
			A 27-year-old married woman hanged herself from the ceiling fan at her father's residence in Indiranagar on Friday. Her father Vinod Kumar Pandey, a veterinary doctor, alleged that harassment at the hands of her in-laws forced the woman to take the extreme step. 

Pandey said his daughter Arti was married to Alambagh resident Gaurav Tripathi in the year 2014. However, soon after the wedding, Arti was harassed for dowry and mentally tortured, he said. On June 27, Arti came to her father's place and stayed aloof for most of the time. Whenever her father asked her if he could sort out things for her, she replied in the negative. 

On Friday, when Pandey came to wake up his daughter, he found her hanging. The police were informed who sent the body for postmortem. Vinod later filed a complaint at Indiranagar police station after which an FIR was lodged against Gaurav Tripathi and his family for dowry death.
