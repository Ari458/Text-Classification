Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			Two days after a 14-year-old girl gave birth to a girl baby, police arrested a 65-year-old man at Selaiyur in Chennai on Wednesday night on rape charges.

The girl was an inmate of the Good Shepherd Children's Home at Gandhi Nagar near Selaiyur in 2014. The home was run by Paul Emanuel. Emanuel's father Prabhudas allegedly raped her several times during her stay at the home.

Later, she left the home and started living with her parents at Sholinganallur. A few days ago, when she complained of stomach ache, she was taken to a private hospital where doctors diagnosed her as pregnant.

The girl gave birth to a baby on Monday. When hospital authorities asked her about the father of the child, she mentioned the name of Prabhudas. She said the senior citizen had raped her on several occasions and threatened her of dire consequences if she told it to others.

Based on a complaint filed by the girl's mother, the police registered a case and arrested Prabhudas. He was remanded in judicial custody.
