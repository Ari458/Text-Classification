Rape, Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			A priest has been arrested for allegedly sexually assaulting a 37-year-old married woman for the past five years in outer Delhi's Rohini Sector 7 area, police said on Saturday.

The victim also alleged that the priest, identified as Rajesh Pandey, video-recorded the act the first time around five years ago and then repeatedly sexually assaulted her by threatening her of leaking the video clip.

"The woman, who lives with her husband and their two children at Rohini Sector 7, had approached Pandey who is a priest at a nearby temple to seek solution to some of her domestic problems. One day, Pandey took her to his residence on the pretext of some ritual and allegedly raped her," said a senior police official quoting the victim's complaint.

Her abuse had been going on since then as he threatened her of posting the alleged video clip on the internet, he added.

Fed up with the years of abuse, the woman finally decided to approach police and registered a complaint against him on Thursday. The priest was subsequently arrested Friday.

His mobile phones and some other gadgets have been seized by the police and sent to FSL to retrieve the alleged video clip.

A case has been registered under relevant sections of the law and investigation is underway, police said.
