Description:
			A teenager has been arrested for allegedly raping his girlfriend's 12-year-old daughter in her school toilet in Bhayander in April last year. The accused and the girl's mother have been arrested after a police complaint was registered last Monday. 

The 19-year-old accused was in a relationship with the girl's mother, aged 35. While they stayed in a hutment on Ghodbunder Road in Thane, the girl was kept in an orphanage in Utan, Bhayander (west). In April last year, the mother and the accused came to visit her in the school. The class fifth student was taken to the toilet and raped by the accused, even as the mother watched, the girl said in her statement to the Utan coastal police, Bhayander (west) on April 13. The girl returned to her orphanage but did not speak about the rape. 

Early this month, the girl confessed to her grandmother about the rape. The orphanage administrator filed a police complaint. The police arrested the mother, who stated that she was threatened by her lover in committing the crime. Investigation revealed that the accused was arrested in October last year by the Kashimira police in connection with theft of cables. He has since been lodged in the Thane jail. 

On Saturday, the police took his custody in the rape case. He and the girl's mother have been remanded to police custody. They have been booked under IPC sections 376 (rape), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offence ( POSCO) Act.
