Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			The family of a six-year-old girl who was allegedly raped and then abandoned in a forested area on October 6, in South West Delhi's Najafgarh have accused the police of inaction.

The case bears similarities to the more recently reported Keshav Puram incident as the victim was first lured and then taken away to the secluded area where the alleged crime was committed.

According to the girl's father, the man they suspect that their neighbour, a young man and a fellow tenant of the same landlord, is the accused as he has been absconding since the incident. He also pins the blame on the police for not taking timely action allowing the man to escape.

On the sequence of events he said that while his daughter went missing in the afternoon, he came to know about it upon his return late in the evening. Then he made a PCR call but the girl could not be traced.

When she regained consciousness on the next day, the girl spotted two CISF jawan jogging near the forests. The personnel informed the PCR and helped her reunite with the family and narrate her ordeal, said her father.

A case has been registered and probe is on.
