Description:
			Nazia Shaikh, a 73-year-old woman, feels grateful towards the court of judicial magistrate (first class) JA Kotnis, which recently directed her son and daughter to provide her with shelter and maintenance as means for her livelihood.

Nazia had filed a private complaint on October 3 before the court under the the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, against her son, daughter, daughter-in-law and son-in-law. The petitioner is the mother of Atiq (39) and Shaina (38) and was residing with her son and daughter-in-law, Mehnaz, at her paternal residence in Bhawani Peth for the last 17 years.

However, her son and daughter-in-law started harassing her mentally and physically last year in August during the month of Ramzan. According to the complaint, her son beat up Nazia. Finally, she filed a complaint with the Kondhwa police station through a social organisation, Chetana Mahila Vikas Kendra.
