Description:
			A local court today awarded life imprisonment to a man for murdering his three sister-in-laws four years ago.

On the night of December 7, 2010, Verma locked the servants' quarter of the PHED guest house near Dhanbad Circuit House where his three sister-in-laws Usha Devi, Tina Devi and Rina Kumar were sleeping.
