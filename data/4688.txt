Rape
Description:
			A 30-year-old widow was allegedly raped and assaulted at Kalyan in neighbouring Thane district by four persons after being kidnapped from the city.

A hunt has been launched for the four men who sexually assaulted the victim at the residence of one of the accused in Kalyan-Goa naka area on Friday night, an official at Malwani police station said.

Two accused have been identified as Rajkumar Choudhary and Nagori Chowdhary, while the identity of the other two is yet to be established.

Rajkumar had on Friday night called the victim to talk to her at suburban Malwani with regard to a complaint she had lodged against his brother Guddukumar.

Guddukumar was arrested by Malwani police for sexually abusing her on the pretext of marrying her.

"As Rajkumar requested her to meet him so that he could speak to her with regard to Guddukumar case, she met him on Friday evening. As soon as the victim reached the place, Rajkumar forced her into a waiting taxi and took her to Nagori's house in Kalyan," the officer added.

The accused then threatened the victim of dire consequences if she did not withdraw the complaint filed against Guddukumar.

As the victim flatly refused to take back the complaint, the four beat her up and took turns to sexually assault her, police said.

The shattered victim remained silent about the offence but she garnered courage and lodged the complaint with Malwani police against the accused yesterday.
