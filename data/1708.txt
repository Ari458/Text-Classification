Abduction, Rape
Description:
			A 32-year-old woman was abducted and gang raped by six people in south-east Delhi at different locations within four hours. 

After her work on Friday, the victim was waiting for a bus. Four youths, including one who was aquainted to the woman, asked her to sit in an Gramin Sewa autorickshaw around 7 pm.

They took her to an isolated land at Nehru Place in south-east Delhi and the three youths, excluding the driver, gang raped her and threatened to kill her. Later, all four of them took the victim to a flat in Madanpur Khadar.

They called one more friend to the flat and this time all five of them, including the Gramin Sewa driver, took turns to rape her again. 

Late at night, they planned to drop the victim near her house. But the vehicle broke down on its way at Nehru Place. A truck driver, whose truck was stationed nearby, came to them on finding things suspicious. The victim asked him for help. At first, the truck driver threatened them but later he too raped the woman.
