Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			Friendship with a stranger over telephone following a cross connection cost a minor girl dear as she was allegedly raped on her first date on Wednesday. Mahila police here on Friday arrested a Plus III student of a city-based college in connection with the incident.

The 16-year-old complainant, who belongs to Muniguda in Rayagada district, reached the city on Tuesday night. "They became friends only a fortnight ago. The couple roamed around the city and visited a mall on Wednesday. The same evening, the youth took her to an isolated place along Tankapani Road where he raped her," said a police officer, quoting the FIR.

After committing the alleged offence, the accused assured the girl that he would marry her soon and dropped her at Baramunda bus stand. But the traumatized girl called up her father, a farmer, and narrated her plight. Her father reached the city on Thursday and she lodged a complaint that evening. Police arrested the accused from his college hostel. The girl underwent medical examination and the report is expected by Saturday.

The accused denied the charges. "I did not rape her. I do not know why she levelled such an allegation on me," he said.

This was not for the first time that such an incident occurred in the capital. On February 15, police arrested four persons for allegedly raping a girl at Chandaka after becoming friends through a popular social networking site. Chandaka had witnessed a similar incident on July 18 last year, in which three persons were arrested.

Last year 81 rape cases were reported in the city of which nearly 95% were allegedly committed by acquaintances of the survivors.
