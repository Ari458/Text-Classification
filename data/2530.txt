Description:
			A case has been registered against an NGO worker here for allegedly torturing a hostel inmate.

The minor girl, who stayed in NGO Surman Sansthan's hostel here after fleeing home, was allegedly tortured by the NGO employee, an allegation rejected by the NGO.

The father of the girl had filed a complaint with Delhi Police and the matter was referred to the Jaipur Police after which an FIR was registered with Vaishali Nagar police station.

The complainant alleged that NGO worker Madhu tortured his daughter and confined her to a room besides forcing her to sweep the house when the girl was staying in the hostel.

The girl, who had left her house, was found roaming at Jaipur railway station in 2011 after which the NGO accommodated her.

She stayed in the hostel for almost one year and fled in August last year.

On the other hand, the NGO Secretary Manan Chaturvedi rejected the allegation terming it baseless and a deliberate attempt to malign the image of the organisation.
