Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A 33-year-old doctor was sent to 14-day judicial custody on Sunday on charges of raping his younger sister for over eight years, police said.

Rajesh Kumar, a doctor at a hospital here, was arrested on Saturday for raping his younger sister since she was a Class 12 student.

He was on Sunday presented before the court of duty magistrate Joginder Singh, who sent him to judicial custody for 14 days, police told IANS.

The woman, who is now an information officer at a central government office in Delhi, is now 27.

She said in her complaint filed at a police station Manesar Saturday that she lived in trauma all these years but suffered in silence fearing social stigma for her and her family.

The family hails from Nainwal village close to the National Security Guard base camp at Manesar, some 20 km from Gurgaon.

The doctor, the only son of his parents, has four other sisters and is married.

He was booked for rape, assault and criminal intimidation.

The woman, who has refused to undergo medical test, said she had shifted to a sister's house in 2005 after she was first sexually abused by her brother.

She said her ordeal continued whenever she came to visit her mother who stays with the accused in Gurgaon.
