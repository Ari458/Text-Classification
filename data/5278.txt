Abduction, Rape
Description:
			Five youths were on Monday arrested here for the alleged gang rape of a 19-year-old girl, police said.

The girl was abducted by the main accused Deepak in an auto-rickshaw and taken to an isolated spot in the eastern suburb where four of his friends joined and allegedly gang raped her, Joint Commissioner of Police Alok Kumar told reporters.

Though the crime took place Saturday evening, the girl's parents lodged a police complaint Sunday after she returned and narrated the sequence of events.

The accused had dropped the girl near her house and fled.

As the girl knew the main accused, we were able to trap him early and round up the four other accused on the basis of information he divulged during investigation. We have registered a case against all of them under section 376 of the Indian Penal Code, Kumar said.

A medical examination of the girl confirmed rape.

The latest incident comes within weeks after a spate of rapes across the city, including that of a six-year-old girl by two gymnastic coaches in an elite school.
