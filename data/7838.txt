Rape
Description:
			The Pollachi All Woman Police on Wednesday arrested a 38-year-old man of Kavarkal Estate first division near waterfalls in Valparai for allegedly raping his mentally challenged neighbour.

According to the police, the incident came to light only a few days ago after the girl's family came to know that she was pregnant.

Police sources said that the 30-year-old victim was living with her mother and grandmother who are tea estate workers. She was usually alone at home during the day.

The accused, M. Periyasamy, a tea estate worker, resided opposite the victim's house. The police said that the man had three children.

It is learnt that the man had asked her to come to his house and sexually assaulted her.

According to the police, he had raped her many times. The woman did not know that she was pregnant.

Medical examination

About 10 days ago, her neighbours grew suspicious and a medical examination confirmed that she was pregnant for eight months.

The police said that the villagers brought the victim to the police station only on Wednesday, after Periyasamy denied raping her.

After inquiry, the police registered a case against Periyasamy under Section 376 (rape) of the Indian Penal Code and arrested him.

He was produced before Judicial Magistrate-I of the Pollachi Court and lodged in Coimbatore Central Prison under judicial custody.

The police said that they would take the DNA sample of the baby to scientifically confirm whether Periyasamy was the father of the child.
