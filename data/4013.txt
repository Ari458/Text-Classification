			A 14-year-old girl, who claimed that she was raped by three youths, was admitted to district government hospital in Dausa with injuries. The police, however, said the girl had fabricated the rape story as she was injured during a consensual physical relationship with a young man. The man was arrested on charges of rape as the girl was a minor. 

The incident took place in Titarwada village near Sainthal police station area. The girl was admitted in the district government hospital in Dausa around 2 am. Police were informed that she had been raped. 

The girl is a Class IX student. She had come home from school during the lunch break. She then went out and returned a few hours later. She was injured. When the family members asked what happed to her, she told them that she was kidnapped and gang raped by three men.

A hunt was launched for the accused men. However, when police were recording the girl's statement, they became doubtful about her story. She was not being able to explain about the incident properly. There were contradictions also. A police team went to the girl's house where her friendship with a youth, identified as Shanu, a resident of UP who works as labourer in the village came to light.
