Child Sexual Abuse, Murder, Rape
Description:
			A local court, on Wednesday, issued bailable warrants against the father and uncle of a child who was killed following a sexual assault. The victim was a three-year-nine-month-old girl whose body was recovered from the jungle area in the vicinity of colony number 4 on April 10. Sources said both the father and uncle did not get their statements recorded despite the issuance of court summons. The next court hearing has been scheduled for October 12.

During his last hearing, the victim's father requested a CBI investigation instead of recording his statement. He alleged the involvement of others, including a juvenile. But the juvenile justice board did not take cognizance of the matter and the case is still under its consideration.

The girl went missing on Friday night and her naked body was found the next day. There were injury marks on her private parts and neck, suggesting rape. The postmortem report revealed that she was strangled to death.

The police have marked an inquiry and Industrial Area SHO Devinder Sharma has been sent on leave. The postmortem was conducted at the general hospital, Sector 16.

A case has been registered under section 302 (Murder), 363 (Punishment for kidnapping) and relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO) at the Industrial Area police station.
