Rape, Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			A school principal in Gadisar village of Banaskantha was booked for allegedly raping a lady teacher.

Kanji Ven (38), principal of Gadisar primary school, was booked following a complaint lodged by the teacher with Tharad police station late on Thursday night. The teacher also named two more persons - Veera Nai (36) and an unidentified person, for abetting the crime.

Investigating officer S K Parmar said that the woman lives in Tharad and commutes to the school that is located some 35km away daily. On Tuesday, the teacher informed Ven that she might be late for the school due to some urgent work. Ven told her that he was in Tharad and would pick her up. She agreed to go with him. However, Ven allegedly took her to a house in some other village on the pretext of receiving some payment. "When they reached the house, the house owner left and shut the doors. Taking advantage of the situation, Ven allegedly raped her," Parmar said, quoting the woman's complaint.

"We have launched a probe but have not arrested the principal yet," Parmar added.
