Domestic Violence
Description:
			The district sessions court sentenced a 26-year-old police constable to three years of rigorous imprisonment for harassing his pregnant wife, also a constable, and driving her to death back in 2012.

Additional sessions Judge VV Bambarde delivered the verdict on Friday after all evidence proved that 23-year-old Archana had set herself ablaze inside their home at Gholainagar, Kalwa on December 19, 2012 as she was fed up by the mental and physical harassment by Sriram Balasaheb Hivre.

The couple had tied the knot just six months back after a long courtship. However, Hivre apparently was involved in an extra-marital affair which had become a bone of contention between the two.

Based on a complaint of harassment and torture filed by the victim's brother Abhijeet Mothe, the police charged the accused for harassment and for the death of Archana.

As the evidence in the court could prove only the charges of harassment mental and physical and hence the court convicted him under section 498A of the IPC and jailed him.
