Domestic Violence, Dowry Harassment
Description:
			A self-proclaimed god-woman has been booked under the Dowry Prohibition Act after a 32-year-old woman from Kandivli accused her of instigating her in-laws and husband, a chartered accountant, to harass her. A criminal offence was registered on Saturday against seven people, including the woman's husband, at the orders of a magistrate court. No arrests have been made yet.

The woman's complaint says that her husband and his family are staunch believers of the godwoman Radhe Maa. The woman has stated that her parents had gifted her ornaments (streedhan) worth Rs1.25 crore for the wedding which her in-laws kept with them. 

"My husband and in-laws used to say I had not got enough jewellery and cash from my parents," she said, adding she was subjected to a lot of torture. 

Calls by TOI to the godwoman went unanswered. 

The woman's lawyer, Kshitij Mehta, said they went to court as the police were "not taking cognizance" of the matter. Senior inspector M Powar of Kandivli police said an inquiry will be done before making any arrest.
