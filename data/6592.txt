Murder, Rape
Description:
			An 18-year-old girl was found dead in an empty field, barely a few meters away from her house in Shahbad Dairy area of outer Delhi today.

The victim was found with her throat slit and in a semi- nude state with the police suspecting that she was sexually assaulted.

A case of murder has been registered by the police at Shahbad Dairy station but no arrest has been made so far.

Police said that the victim went to fetch water from a container outside her house but did not return. As her family members began looking for her, she was discovered lying in a pool of blood.

The family said she was alive but succumbed to her injuries on her way to the hospital and they immediately informed the police about the incident.

Initial investigation revealed that the victim had a scuffle with the attacker before she was murdered.

"The woman had minor injury marks, suggesting a fight.

Her body was dragged by the assailant to an isolated spot where she was dumped," said a police official.

Police have sent the body for post-mortem to ascertain the cause of death.

"Autopsy report would shed more light if she was sexually assaulted or not. Reports are still awaited. We have registered a case of murder and have started investigating," a senior police officer said.

Cops have started questioning her family members and neighbours.
