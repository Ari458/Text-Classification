Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A 14-year-old schoolboy has been arrested for sexually abusing a three-and-a-half-year-old baby, who lives next-door and called him bhai (brother). The accused was a next door neighbour of the survivor whom she often referred as her own "bhai." 

Investigators say that the boy called the child to his home around 8.15pm on Friday. "When the toddler returned, she seemed uneasy. It was her mother who found something amiss and questioned her. The child's statement made her realize the gravity of the crime and she contacted police. The child was sent to the hospital for a check-up and the boy was apprehended," said an officer.The accused has been charged with rape and various sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act. 

National Crime Records Bureau data shows that minors were involved in 86 rapes and 66 cases of kidnapping and murder in Bengal last year. In Kolkata, 60% juvenile criminals lived with their parents, defying common perceptions.
