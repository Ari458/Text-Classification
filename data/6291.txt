			A seven-year-old girl was allegedly raped by a youth at Panas Gam area in the city, police said today.

The accused, identified as Swaminath Nishad (22), was arrested for the incident that took place last night, they said.

The girl, whose parents are from Nepal and now settled in the city, went missing from near her house in Althan area last night. When her family failed to trace her, they approached Khatodara police and filed a missing person report.

"Around 11.30 pm, the girl was spotted by some local residents at a farm in Panas Gam area. The girl, who was injured in the incident, was admitted to a civil hospital," police inspector of Khatodara police station G R Patel said.

Meanwhile, a police team patrolling the area spotted a man in a suspicious condition near the farm.

"Police found blood stains on his hand and clothes.

When he was questioned, he failed to give any satisfactory reply. He was then taken to hospital for medical test and kept under detention," said Patel.

Forensic reports proved that the blood stains on his clothes were that of the girl, Patel said, adding, "Based on the report, we arrested Nishad on charge of rape. Primary investigation revealed that he had abducted the girl near her house by offering some gift and then raped her." 

The accused worked as a labourer and lived near the victim's house.

Further investigation into the case is on.
