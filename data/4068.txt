Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			Police have registered a case under the Nirbhaya Act against a software firm owner after a 23-year-old human resources (HR) manager lodged a complaint against him alleging sexual harassment.

The culprit has been identified as Parameshwar Rao, owner of a software firm on Road Number 3, Banjara Hills, and father of the firm's MD.

Since the past several months, the culprit has been harassing the 23-year-old MBA graduate, who was working as HR manager at the firm, for sexual favours.

Parameshwar Rao has been harassing the victim to cooperate with him by promising to give her promotion and salary hike. A fortnight ago, he held her hand and subsequently she resigned from the job.

The victim came to the police and lodged a complaint against Parameshwar Rao. A case was registered against him under section 354 (Assault or use of criminal force to a woman to outrage her modesty) of the IPC. Rao, a resident of LB Nagar, went absconding and a man-hunt has been launched to nab him.
