Abuse
Description:
			A bargirl who lives in Mira Road, was travelling in an auto rickshaw around 1.30 am in the wee hours of Sunday, when Rathod (Cop 1) and Dandekar (Cop 2), saw her. They asked her to stop for no apparent reason, except to allegedly extract money from her. But the girl, sensing trouble, refused. The cops started abusing and harassing, refusing to back off from their demand for money.

At this time, she dialled the number of the policeman she was well acquainted with. The official told her to trick the constables into entering the Kashimira police station compound as they followed her.
