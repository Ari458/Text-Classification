Description:
			The Hingane couple, originally from Amravati, had migrated to Bori Tawun. Initially, the husband-wife duo worked to earn a living. Later, it was Kalpana who continued working while Narendra took to alcohol and looked down upon his responsibilities. Narendra Hingane was apparently upset with his wife Kalpana who had refused to give him money to buy liquor.
