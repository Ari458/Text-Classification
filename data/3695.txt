Description:
			Jammu and Kashmir Police has arrested a teacher for allegedly raping a minor student who used to visit his home for tuitions.

Parvez Ahmad (40) was arrested for raping a class nine student in Barzulla area of Srinagar city.

The 15-year-old girl, whose father died in an accident some years, complained that Ahmad raped her at his residence where he was running a coaching centre and then threatened her not to reveal anything.

The girl was taking tuitions from Ahmad, a private school teacher, since last year and had gone to his home to deposit the fee.

Two boys were taking tuitions at Ahmad's residence when the girl reached there, but Ahmad asked both of them to leave.

Ahmad forced himself upon the girl as there was no one else in the home at that time.

Though the preliminary examination of the victim has confirmed rape, the official said the doctors have "reserved their opinion".

The police official said Ahmad has "confessed" that he "committed a mistake".

The girl also alleged that Ahmad had threatened her of killing her and her brother if she revealed his identity to anyone.
