Description:
			In-laws of 25-year-old Mamta Choudhary publicly burnt her by tying her to a tree and setting her afire by pouring petrol. Mamta died while she was being admitted to Medical College and Hospital in Nagpur.

Mamta was married to Jageshwar Choudhary of village Dawwa in Sadak Arjuni tehsil on April 2010. She also had a child. She had repeatedly told her parents that she was being harassed by her in-laws to bring money from her parents. On November 13, she was asked to call up her parents and tell them that they should send her Rs 20,000 as was promised earlier. Since this demand was not met, her sister-in-law, husband, father-in-law, mother-in-law and two brothers-in-law gathered in Dawwa and harassed her throughout the night on November 14. In the early hours of November 15, they allegedly tied her to a nearby tree and set her on fire. Villagers said that they had seen flames behind the house of Choudhary and offered help to douse fire. But the Choudhary family kept them at a bay. Even today, a couple of branches of the tree to which Mamta was tied are seen roasted by the flames of fire
