Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			An 82-year-old man was on Tuesday awarded 10 years of rigorous jail term and a Rs 10,000 fine for raping a four-year-old girl in 2011.

Special judge Mandi Baldev Singh said Bakshi Ram, a resident of village Bhagwan Dhangar of Sarkaghat, would have to undergo two years of simple imprisonment if he fails to submit the fine.

Ram had sexually assaulted the girl while she was playing with his granddaughter.

Medical examination of the victim confirmed rape while potency test on the convict was positive.

On the quantum of sentence the court observed though minimum sentence of 10 years was provided for offence under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO Act) which can be extended up to life imprisonment, it took a lenient view in this case as the convict is an old-aged person.
