Child Sexual Abuse, Rape, Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			A four-year-old kindergarten student from Nalasopara was allegedly sexually abused by her drawing teacher in the school last week. A woman helper of the school has also been accused of aiding the teacher. No arrest has been made. 

The parents of the child and other students on Saturday took a morcha to the school located in Nalasopara (east) demanding action against the teacher. A case of rape under section 376 of the IPC and under sections of the Protection of Children Against Sexual Offences Act was later registered against the teacher. The helper who allegedly escorted the girl to a room in the school where the exploitation allegedly took place, has also been booked for rape. 

The teacher is believed to have sexually abused the senior kindergarten student on several occasions last week. When her parents learnt about the abuse on Thursday, they approached the school authorities. Parents alleged that the school administration did not entertain them and was shielding the teacher. The suspect was reportedly called to the Tuling police station on Thursday but let off after questioning. This angered the parents who gathered outside the school on Saturday. 

At the school gate the parents were stopped by the security guard. They forcibly barged through the gate and charged towards the principal's cabin. The principal was not in the school. The security guards called the police who reached the spot and assured the parents that action would be taken against the accused. 

The parents alleged that the teacher had sexually abused atleast three to four minor girls. No other parent, however, has approached the police with a complaint. Police said that the girl will be send for medical test to ascertain the sexual abuse before any arrests are made.
