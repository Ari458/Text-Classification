Child Sexual Abuse, Molestation, Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			A nine-year-old girl was allegedly molested by a security guard of the government school in which she studied, police said today while adding that the accused has been arrested.

The incident took place on Saturday afternoon when the victim was returning home after school in South Delhi's Safdarjung Enclave area.

"The girl was heading home after classes when she was picked up by the guard. The victim knew him so she did not protest initially, but he touched her inappropriately after taking her in his lap. Scared by the incident, the girl rushed home and narrated the incident to her parents," said a police official quoting the victim's statement.

As the school was over for the day and the next day was Sunday, her parents met the school authorities on Monday to apprise them about the incident and then informed police.

"A case of molestation was registered on Monday at Safdarjung Enclave Police station and the accused was arrested soon after. The name of the accused and the school is not being revealed as it could reveal the identity of the victim," the official said.
