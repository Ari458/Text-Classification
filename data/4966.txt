Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			In a horrific incident, a nine-month-old has been raped allegedly by her cousin at Dadrauli village in Sambhal district, 180 km from Agra. But in this case her own parents are unwilling to go to the police. The girl was brought in a critical condition by her father and relatives to a private hospital in Firozabad road here on Thursday night.

"This was a brutal rape. The girl needed immediate plastic surgery as her intestinal path has been badly ruptured. We referred her to the district hospital as we do not have necessary facilities in our hospital," said Dr Geeta Yadav, who treated the baby.

"The baby's father cried whole night. He was regretting that he could not get justice for his own child as he is being pressurized by his wife and her kin not to report to the police," said a hospital attendant.

Circle officer of Hariparwat police station who reached the spot also remained tightlipped over the issue. He left the spot by claiming that the matter is not under his jurisdiction.

SSP Shalabh Mathur confirmed the report about the rape incident. "We are trying to contact her parents," he added.

The case exhibits apathy of the country where boy is superior to girl, even if he rapes his own sister.

A doctor of the hospital where the victim was admitted shouted on media when asked that why the hospital authorities have not report to the police.

"Isiliye to Hum Bachte Hain Aise cases ko lene se as media wale pareshan kar denge," the doctor said.
