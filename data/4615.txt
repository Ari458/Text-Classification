Description:
			A fast-track court (FTC) in the city has sentenced a 33-year-old man, his mother and sister to undergo seven-year imprisonment for demanding dowry and abetting the suicide of his pregnant wife in 2010. 

In a judgement on Monday, the XV FTC judge Shuklaksha Palan ordered all three to pay a fine of Rs 50,000 and part of the fine Rs 40,000 to be paid to the surviving son of the couple aged six years. The court has found that Sagayanadan, husband of Latha alias Elizabeth,24, was married in July 2005 and were living in Ambedkarnagar of Vijinapura. 

Sagayanandan, his mother Mary and sister Lilly Malar used to harass Latha demanding Rs 3 lakh as dowry from her house for buying a car. All three used to abuse, assault and mentally harass her for failing to meet their demand. Unable to bear their torture, Latha committed suicide by hanging in their house on March 28, 2010. At the time of her death Latha was seven months pregnant.

Ramamurthynagar police registered a case of dowry harassment and dowry death against the three and filed a chargesheet before the court. The court also ordered Mary to undergo three years imprisonment and to pay a fine of Rs 5000 and in default to undergo simple imprisonment for nine months.
