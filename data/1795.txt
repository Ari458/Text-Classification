Description:
			Two teenagers were sprayed with acid in their sleep early on Monday in Patna district for spurning the advances of a youth. The girls, an 18-year-old intermediate student and her 12-year-old sister, were sleeping on the terrace of their house at Chhitnawan village under Maner police station when the attack took place. It seems that a group of youths barged into the house and threw acid on the girls, said a police officer. Both the girls have been admitted to Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH).

Police said the older sibling suffered severe burn injuries on her face and was in a serious condition, while her sister, who received burn injuries on her face, chest and a hand, was out of danger. The girls were immediately taken to Danapur Sadar Hospital from where they were referred to PMCH for treatment, police added.

The girls have accused one Anil Kumar and his associates of throwing acid on them.

Police said the girls used to go to Danapur to attend computer-coaching classes, where Kumar and his associates allegedly used to follow them and pass lewd comments.
  
Kumar has been harassing us at the coaching classes. Four days ago, he had forcibly entered the house and threatened us with dire consequences,said the older sibling.
