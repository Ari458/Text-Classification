Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A 36-year-old man was arrested for the alleged rape of his 12-year-old daughter in Attur here on Sunday.

The police said that K. Muniraj, a labourer, was married for 13 years and has a 12-year-old daughter and 11-year-old son. He stopped going to work and was at home. Muniraj in an inebriated condition frequently argued with his wife. Hence, she left for her parent’s house and was staying there for the past six months.

He sexually assaulted his daughter while she was alone at home and also threatened her not to reveal it to anyone. On Saturday, Muniraj pacified his wife and brought her home. The girl revealed the incidents to her mother. Based on her mother’s complaint, the Attur police registered a case under Section 376 (rape) of IPC and Section 5 r/w 6 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 and arrested Muniraj. He was produced in the court and lodged at Salem Central Prison.

The girl is undergoing treatment at the Government Hospital in Attur.
