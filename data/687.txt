Description:
			Residents ransacked the thatched house of a Dalit woman in the village, suspecting that she might have stolen gold and silver ornaments from the local Kali temple. 
The next day, some villagers suspected that Basanti Das, a Dalit woman who lives in a thatched house near the temple might have committed the burglary.

Enraged, they ransacked her house and allegedly took away a bi-cycle and some paddy.
