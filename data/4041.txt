Crime, Other
Description:
			Police are on look out for a man, who allegedly sexually harassed a village girl in West Champaran district by opening an account in her name on the social networking site, 'Facebook', and posting obscene comments on 'her' wall.

After initial inquiries following an FIR lodged against unknown people by the victim's brother, the Bettiah police have referred the case to the Economic Offences Wing (EOW)'s cyber crime branch of the state police. The case has been lodged with Majhaulia police station under Section 354A of the IPC, the stringent provision introduced in the penal law in the wake of the Nirbhaya case, along with Section 72A of the Information Technology Act, 2000. This is the first time police have received a complaint that attracts these two penal provisions of law. In his complaint, Shafiqur Rahman of Mahanwa Baraihia Tola described his dismay when co-villager Jawed Alam showed him a Facebook page on his (Smart)phone.

Rahman's sister's photograph stared at him from the cellphone screen. His sister, an under-matric, doesn't know computers. 'Her' wall lists Mumbai under the 'Places lived in' column while Bettiah is listed as her hometown. It shows February 1996 as her date of birth that clearly establishes her minority status.

Police's preliminary inquiries suggest the girl's picture was taken near her own home as the bamboo grove in the frame establishes, speculating someone from the village, who probably has worked either in Mumbai or the Gulf, might be the culprit. EOW's cyber crime branch will put under scanner the 18 men, all belonging to the girl's community, whose names figure in the mutual friends' list.

The case, first of its kind in these parts of the country, brings the hammer of India's new rape law to the hinterland.
