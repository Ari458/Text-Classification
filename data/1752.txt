Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			Police have arrested a 26-year-old autorickshaw driver after a hearing impaired schoolgirl, who is a state-level athlete, lodged a complaint of rape against him last evening.

According to police sources, the girl alleged that Ranjit Das, the autorickshaw driver had offered to drop her home when she was waiting at Siliguri More around 6.30pm on Sunday in pouring rain.

The girl had waited at a bus stop for nearly an hour to return home from her tuition classes but no bus or autorickshaw had passed by.

She told the police that when she got into the autorickshaw, there were other passengers in the vehicle. When the autorickshaw stopped at a village near her home, the others got off. 

Ranjit then told the girl he would drop her closer to her house.

In the police complaint, the girl wrote that instead of dropping her home, Ranjit took her to his house, saying that he could not see the road well in the blinding rain. 

The girl said Das parked the autorickshaw and took her home. She said Ranjit's mother was at home when she went in. 

The victim said when the rain stopped around 9.30pm, she told Ranjit she would go home. The girl's house is around 3km from Ranjit's house. 

But he locked the door of the house and raped the victim several times.
