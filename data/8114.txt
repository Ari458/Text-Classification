Abuse
Description:
			A man was arrested for stalking and filming girls on his cellphone on the roads around Greater Kailash and Lajpat Nagar. He also used to threaten the women with dire consequences if they objected to it.

The incident came to the fore when a woman caught the man, Mohammad Zareef, on Thursday afternoon near Chirag Dilli and raised an alarm. The woman claimed that the youth followed her for some time and clicked a few photographs. When she objected to it, he first ignored her and later threatened her with an acid attack.

In her complaint, the woman said that she was on her way to work at a private firm in Greater Kailash when the incident occurred. The accused claimed to be an admirer and made indecent proposals. She then called the PCR.

During interrogation, Zareef said that he was a resident of Ambedkar Nagar. He is unemployed and was found involved in petty crimes.

A case under IPC sections of outraging the modesty of a woman and criminal intimidation has been registered against Zareef. His mobile phone has been seized and sent for forensic analysis to find out whether he would morph the photographs.
