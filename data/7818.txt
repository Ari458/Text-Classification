Description:
			A 36-year-old man, identified as Nazir of Nemom, was arrested on Friday by the Parassala police on charges of sexually abusing a physically challenged woman.

According to the police, Nazir, a sales agent for SIM cards, had recently met the victim, a saleswoman with a fancy store. He befriended her and apart from allegedly sexually exploiting her at the shop, he allegedly exploited her at her residence as well.
