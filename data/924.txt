Abuse
Description:
			The accused had been sexually exploiting the girl since long. A case had been registered against accused Naseem Qureshi, an assistant teacher at a government junior high school in a village in Ghatampur.


Incidents such as this should not be tolerated. Neither by the Parents nor by the Society in general. Imagine sending our kids to school and living in a perenial fear that they might be victims to sexual predators. And this is not just limited to Government run schools. I can assure you that such perversity has been reported from well placed schools as well.
