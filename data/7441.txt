Abduction, Rape
Description:
			The Kandivali police arrested a youth on charges of kidnapping and raping a 16-year-old girl who lived in his neighbourhood. The couple was traced to Bihar where the accused had married the girl. As the girl is a minor, having a sexual relationship with her would tantamount to rape, as per law. 

The 22-year-old accused works as a construction labourer and lives in Kandivali East. The girl is a class X passout. Her family had a hint of the accused's interest in her. On July 6, the girl left home for praying. When she did not return for a long time, her family started looking for her. They eventually approached the police. "We found that the youth too had vanished. His cellphone was put under surveillance and the location turned out to be his hometown in Bihar. On July 14, a team of officers went to Bihar," said a senior police official. 

"The couple had tied the knot in Bihar but as the girl is underage, their marriage is not legal. The accused was arrested and brought to Mumbai on July 18. He was produced before a magistrate court which remanded him to police custody till July 24," said the official. The girl was sent back to her parents.
