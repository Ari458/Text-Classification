Rape
Description:
			The girl - a Std IX student was studying at her home in Juni Mangalwari when the accused came in and gave her money to buy two popsicles. "She was studying and her mother was busy in kitchen. He came and gave her Rs 5 asking her to buy two popsicles, one for himself and other for her, from a nearby shop," said the father. Never suspecting anything, the mother allowed the girl to take the money. Later, the boy took her to the under construction house and forced himself upon her. 

The girl's father and neighbours alleged that two years ago, the boy, then 13-year-old, was caught while molesting his other cousin, who also stays nearby. "He was beaten and left with a warning," said the father.
