			A 23-year-old married woman was found dead under mysterious circumstances at her in-laws' house in Shalimar Garden of Sahibabad area in the district, police said today.

Sahibabad police station house officer Upendra Yadav said that upon complaint of the father of deceased Meenakshi, a case under Section 304-B (dowry death) of IPC has been registered against her husband and seven other family members.

Rajvir, a resident of Narela in Delhi, told police that his daughter was married to cab driver Pradeep in 2013.

He said Meenakshi's husband and in-laws were in the habit of torturing her for not bringing sufficient dowry. A girl child was also born to her six months ago thereafter the in-laws became more aggressive towards her, he said.

Last night his son-in-law Pradeep called him and informed that Meenakshi has inflicted a self-injury on her head, but Pradeep insisted him not to come in the night.

Again in the midnight, her sister-in-law Shiksha called him to inform that Meenakshi has committed suicide by hanging herself from a ceiling fan, Rajvir said.

"When I reached there, I found the dead body of my daughter lying on a bed," Rajvir told police.

The dead body has been sent for post-mortem, Yadav said, adding that Assistant Superintendent of Police Vipin Tada is conducting probe into the case.
