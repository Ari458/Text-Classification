Child Sexual Abuse, Murder, Rape
Description:
			Three youths accused in the alleged gang-rape case of a 16-year-old girl were arrested by Tamenglong district on Wednesday.

Residents of Oktan Khun of Tamenglong district Aphong (20), Abun (19) and Alingba (19) were arrested by the police from their houses around 3 pm, sources said.

The victim also hailed from Oktan Khun.

Family of the victim had claimed that the police refused to register a case over the 'gruesome crime' .

The family of the victim insisted that the girl was sexually assaulted by the trio before she was being brutally murdered.

The accused then hung her from the ceiling of an abandoned house.

The ghastly incident took place on June 4 last.

The victim was a Class VIII student.

The family said the victim girl's body was spotted by a kid who entered the abandoned house to search his toy.

Father of the victim had pleaded with the village authority to take drastic action against the accused, but a huge public meeting at the village held on June 7 decided to close the case by asking the families of the accused to pay Rs 15 lakh to the next of kin as compensation.

However, the father said he had not received the compensation.

Meanwhile, the body of the victim girl, which was buried according to the custom but without conducting post-mortem, is likely to be exhumed for the same if the police register a case over the alleged rape and murder.
