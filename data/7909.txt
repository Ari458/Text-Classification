Molestation, Street Harassment
Description:
			A 21-year-old college student has complained to police that the assistant public relations officer of a state minister sexually abused her in RA Puram on Thursday night. 

The woman handed over to the Abiramapuram police the ID card of her alleged tormentor and said she had given him a sound thrashing. Police, however, did not register a case saying the woman did not return on Friday to file a formal complaint. 

Police said Abinaya (name changed) , a native of Kerala who stays in RA Puram, visited an ice-cream parlour near her house with a friend. She told police they were returning home around 10.30pm when they saw two men standing on the road. 

One of the men, she claimed, suddenly pounced on her and sexually abused her. She said she was shocked but quickly regained composure and overpowered the man. Some residents of the area and passersby rushed to the spot hearing her screams. Seeing many people approach, the man and his friend ran away. Abinaya said she managed to snatch the man's identity which gave his name as Divakar and his designation. 

All efforts by this correspondent to reach Divakar failed as he had switched off his mobile phone. The woman too could not be contacted for comment. 

A senior officer said, "The woman promised to visit the police station on Friday morning. But she never came back."
