People who are supposed to protect the Law and act against such social evil are themselves the culprits. This is not the first time that someone belonging to the "Force" has been arrested in cases of Dowry Harassment. Strict Action should be taken against all the accused in this regard. Including the Husband, who obviously turned a blind eye to the torture that his wife and lover was going through.
