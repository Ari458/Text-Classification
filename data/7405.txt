Abduction
Description:
			In Golaghat, the police picked up two boys last night on charges of allegedly kidnapping a three-year-old girl.

The mother of the girl said around 1pm yesterday, two dishevelled boys had come to her paternal house in the Pani Tanki area of the town and had asked for food.

The girl was playing in the courtyard at that time, her mother said.

"After giving them food, we got busy with household chores. After some time, I found my daughter missing and we informed other family members and neighbours who started searching for her. In the meantime, a relative found my child with the two boys and brought her to our residence, which is near my parents' house. The boys managed to give us the slip," she said.

"Around 11pm last night, the boys again came to our house this time asking to use the toilet. When we questioned them why they took away my daughter in the morning, they failed to give any convincing answer. Subsequently, we informed the police," she added.

"The boys were handed over to the police last night and my husband filed an FIR in Golaghat police station," the woman said.

A Golaghat police officer said they had received a complaint regarding the alleged kidnapping attempt and were investigating the matter.

"The law will take its own course," he said.

According to Section 2 (k) of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000, defines "juvenile" or "child" as a person who has not completed 18 years.
