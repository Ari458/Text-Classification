Foeticide/Infanticide
Description:
			A new born who had been left to die by her parents, was rescued by well-meaning strangers and given proper treatment. Having been dumped in a dustbin and stuck in the muck there, doctors say its nothing short of a miracle that she survived.

The incident comes at a time when the government has stepped up its efforts to curb female foeticide, clamping down on radiologists who help parents know if their unborn child is male or female.

She was first taken to Kasturba Mother and Child Hospital, where the placenta was removed and umbilical cord was cut. She was washed and treated with a disinfectant. Later in the day, she was shifted to Cooper Hospital, where she has been kept in a warmer. Doctors say her condition is stable.
