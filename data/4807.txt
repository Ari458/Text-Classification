			A 10-year-old alleged gang-rape victim was allegedly abducted from outside her house in Ganganagar area.

The minor was playing outside her home yesterday when the incident happened, SSP Omkar Singh said.

The girl's family have registered a complaint against two unidentified persons and one Sunita, mother of one of the accused in the gang-rape case of the same victim, suspecting their involvement in the adduction.

Sunita'a son Arvind and two other unidentified persons on March 18, had allegedly abducted the minor and gang-raped her after drugging her in a hostel in Ganganagar, police said, adding Arvind was arrested on March 20 and sent to jail, while rest two are yet to be arrested.
