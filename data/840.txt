Description:
			The accused had been fighting with Sriramulu, his father, for a share in the family property. Sriramulu married Seetharavamma, 50, after the death of his first wife and had a daughter with her. It was learnt that the son suspected his stepmother and sister Saidurga, 20, of having a role to play behind Sriramulu's refusal to yield. Enraged by this, he hacked his stepmother and sister to death with an axe.
