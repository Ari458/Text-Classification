Dowry Harassment
Description:
			A local court has sentenced a man to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment for abetting his wife's suicide for dowry.

Karimnagar Fast Track Court Judge G Venkata Krishnam Raju yesterday convicted 33-year-old Tirupathi and sentenced him to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment.

According to the Additional Public Prosecutor Sardar Harjeeth Singh, Tirupathi had married Kolipaka Ranjitha in 2004 at Kolanoor village of Odela mandal.

At the time of marriage, Ranjitha's parents had given Rs 2 lakh as dowry. However, after a few years, Tirupathi and his parents started harassing Ranjitha for more dowry.

As she could not take on the pressure, Ranjitha finally committed suicide in February 2011.

Based on a complaint lodged by the victim's parents, police had registered a case and launched investigation.

Though the court acquitted the woman's in-laws, Tirupathi was convicted.
