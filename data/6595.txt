Murder
Description:
			Body of a 35-year-old married woman was found under mysterious conditions at her house in Khoda police station area here, police said today.

Sarita Singh was found dead at her house in Rajiv Vihar under Khoda police station area today, SHO Khoda, Arun Kumar Singh said.

The incident was reported by Prabal Pratap, husband of the deceased who alleged that his wife committed suicide by hanging herself from a ceiling fan, police said.

The woman's body was lying on her bed when the police reached the spot, they said.

"The husband is being questioned. He told the police that the body was disentangled from the ceiling by the family members," SHO said.

An FIR has been lodged in the matter following the complaint by Ram Bhadur, brother of deceased against Pratap, Yogendra, Jyoti and Nitendra.

The post mortem report, however, contradicts the complainant's version and specifically mentions that Sarita died due to hanging, police said, adding that probe is on in the matter.
