Rape
Description:
			A 20-year-old girl was allegedly raped by a 40-year-old private teacher at Jat Kuien Ka Raasta under Nahargarh police station area in the city on Tuesday. Though the incident took place early on Tuesday, alert cops managed to arrest the accused within hours.

According to the police, the accused Radhey Shyam Sharma earns his livelihood through coaching classes. A resident of Jhunjhunu, Radhey Shyam was staying in the area in a rented accommodation. The victim was known to the accused.

The victim's family is very poor and cares little for her and she lived in a desolate hut in the area and depended on neighbours for food. She later told the police that on Monday night the accused "lured" her to his room and raped her. Locals of the area saw her screaming and rushing out of Radhey shyam's house on Tuesday morning.

The girl in her statement said she was raped earlier by him but was too scared to speak out.

Police also added that the girl was scared, but following the probe, she finally told the cops that she was raped by the accused at least three times earlier.
