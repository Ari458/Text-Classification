Molestation, Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			A faculty member at IIIT-Allahabad has been booked for allegedly sexually harassing a female student, police said today.

The complainant, an M.Tech (Bioinformatics) student, had lodged a complaint with the IIIT-A authorities as well as at the Dhoomanjganj police station, accusing her Head of the Department Shiva Prasad of sexually harassing her, Dhoomanganj SHO R S Sonkar said.

An FIR was subsequently lodged under relevant sections of IPC and Sexual Harassment Act on Tuesday following which a police team raided Prasad's residence, located in the institute premises, yesterday, he added.

The professor was said to be out of station at the time of the raid at his residence which has been sealed while his computer and diary have been seized, he said.

Meanwhile, the institute has also constituted a four- member team, headed by senior faculty member Krishna Mishra, which recorded the statements of the victim yesterday and is likely to seek the teacher's version as soon as he returns, sources in the IIIT-A said.
