Description:
			A 14-year-old girl was allegedly raped and beaten by her neighbour in Chhattisgarh's Bilaspur district.

The accused, Rajesh Dodar (30) was arrested yesterday after the minor girl complained that he raped and thrashed her on May 11 at Sewar village in Chakarbhata region, Bilaspur Additional Superintendent of Police Vijay Pandey said.

On Sunday evening, Rajesh took the victim's father on his motorcycle for attending a wedding function near their village. On their way to the marriage venue, the duo consumed liquor and then entered into an argument over some issue following which Rajesh thrashed him brutally.

Rajesh later went to the victim's house and told the girl that her father had met with an accident and needed to be shifted to hospital, the ASP said.

He asked the girl to accompany him but she initially refused.

He kept persuading her and when she finally agreed, he took her on his bike and allegedly raped her at an isolated place beside Hardi bypass road, a few kms away from their native place, Pandey said.

When the girl tried to resist, he thrashed her badly and fled from the spot leaving her injured.

The victim managed to reach her home with the help of locals and informed her relatives about the offence following which they lodged a case against Rajesh yesterday.

The accused has been booked under various sections of IPC (Indian Penal Code) for raping the minor and thrashing her father, the ASP said, adding further probe was on.

The victim and her father were initially admitted to a local hospital in Bilha from where they were shifted to Bilaspur district hospital.
