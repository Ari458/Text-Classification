Dowry Harassment
Description:
			A son-in-law of a senior Delhi police official was remanded to judicial custody for a day by a Delhi court following his arrest in connection with a dowry harassment case.
   
Metropolitan Magistrate Preeti Parewa sent the accused, who works with an MNC firm at Gurgaon, to jail after declining the plea of police that they be allowed to interrogate him in their custody for two days.
    
The accused was arrested from his office after a complaint was lodged at Hauz Khas police station that he and some of his family members were "harassing" his wife, the daughter of a Joint Commissioner of Delhi Police, since her marriage in June 2012.
    
Meanwhile, the court today refused to hear the bail plea of the accused saying it would be dealt by the Magistrate.
    
The woman, in the complaint, alleged that her parents fulfilled dowry demands at the time of their marriage.
    
The accused opposed the harassment allegations saying his parents were not staying with him.
