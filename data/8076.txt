Molestation, Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			Rupesh Samant, former Goa Chief of Bureau of the Press Trust of India who was evading arrest in a sexual harassment case, surrendered in court here on Sunday morning.

Chief Judicial Magistrate Ashley Noronha remanded him to three days in police custody.

The High Court of Bombay at Goa had rejected Mr. Samants appeal challenging an order of an Additional Sessions Court a fortnight ago rejecting his plea for anticipatory bail. He has been accused of sexually harassing women journalists and a few others.

A JMFC court here on Monday issued a Non-Bailable Warrant (NBW) against him on an appeal by the city women police probing the cases.

Mr. Samant had reportedly gone into hiding after the first FIR was registered at the city womens police station on September 24.
