Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A 17-year-old girl became pregnant after being raped several times by a distant relative, in Kunnathunad. The matter came to light when the class X student fell unconscious at school a week ago. She was three months pregnant. After the victim's family hesitated to file a complaint, the girl was convinced by NGO Childline to registered a complaint with the Kunnathunad police station on Wednesday. 

The girl's family or school authorities did not lodge a police complaint. The parents took the girl to several hospitals for an abortion, but hospitals refused to do so. A private hospital in Ernakulam allegedly demanded Rs 65,000 to terminate the pregnancy. Unable to pay the amount, the parents allegedly went to the accused's house and demanded money. The neighbours who came to know of this, informed Childline, who contacted the victim and convinced her to file a police complaint. 

The accused is a distant relative and father of two. Police alleged that the accused sexually abused the girl several times at her house. She was alone at her home at the time her parents, both daily wage workers, were out on work. 

Police said the victim had revealed that she was abused several times by her relative, whom she called "uncle" when she was at home due to illness.
