Rape
Description:
			A six-year old girl was raped and murdered in a temple auditorium under construction in KG Halli in Bangalore East on Friday evening. 

The girl was at home looking after her younger brother . When the parents came back in the evening, they found the girl missing from the tent where they stayed. After three hours of searching, her body was found in a room in the building under construction. 

The neighbours told police the girl used to go the Sri Narasimha Temple nearby to receive the food distributed in the evening. She was seen going to the temple on Saturday too. The post mortem revealed she'd been raped before being strangled to death.
