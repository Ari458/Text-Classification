			Jhansirani (22), the elder daughter of Pitchai (42) and Amudha (40), was married to Suresh in Sikoor village in Perambalur district. On January 26, Jhansirani had consumed poison. Despite treatment she died on January 27. The incident happened  a week ago in Sikoor near Agaram in Perambalur.

Though the girl's husband was initially framed, Inquiries with the younger daughter revealed that both of them were molested by their father. Though Jhansirani complained to her mother Amudha about her father's crookedness, she could not get justice from her. Later, Amudha also died. Eventhough Jhansirani had been married to Suresh, Pitchai kept on torturing her. Distressed by such treatment, Jhansirani shared her bitter experience with her younger sister. It was another shock to Jhansirani that her sister had also been molested by her father.
