Rape
Description:
			A 35-year-old physically-challenged woman was allegedly raped by a 29-year-old youth. The incident took place late on Monday evening when the victim with disability in legs are disabled was alone at her house.

The accused sneaked into the house and started making immoral gestures towards the victim. When she resisted, the accused shut the windows and door of the house and raped her. The victim’s shouts for help caught the attention of the neighbours and they rushed to the house. Finding the door bolted from inside, the neighbours started banging the door.
