Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			Three teenaged boys were arrested and sent to the Juvenile detention centre today for allegedly sexually harassing a minor girl at a village in the district, police said today.

The incident took place last night, when the 13-year-old victim hailing from Vellalapatty village, had gone to relieve herself at a field near her home, after informing her mother, last night.

When she failed to return home, her mother went looking for her and was shocked to find three teenagers trying to sexually assault her, they said.

Immediately, she raised an alarm and some of the villagers arrived at the spot and caught the boys, who were later handed over to police.
The girl's mother lodged a complaint with police who registered a case under Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences Act and apprehended the boys, who were from the same village. While two boys were aged 16, the other was 14, police said.

The girl was taken to hospital for check-up, they added.

The boys were produced before the Juvenile Court, which sent them to the Salem Juvenile home.
