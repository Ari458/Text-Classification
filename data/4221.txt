Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A teenage girl has alleged she was raped by a youth in a house in Ranganatha Colony, in Jagjeevan Ram Nagar police limits.

The girl and boy were both residents of Cottonpet and were allegedly having an affair for the past few months. On February 16, the boy's family held a housewarming ceremony in Ranganatha Colony. After the function, the youth, aged 22, took the teenager to the empty house and allegedly abused her sexually.

The girl's family demanded that the boy marry her. However, the boy's family wasn't yet keen on the idea. Following this, the girl's family approached police and with the help of a few women's organizations, filed a complaint of rape against the boy with the JJ Nagar police.
