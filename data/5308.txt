Molestation, Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			Woman weightlifter from Punjab has put allegations of sexual assault on her coach. She has ended her commonwealth game campaign on the number five spot in 58 kg category in Glasgow. Weightlifter, posted in the Punjab armed battalion, has registered her complaint against coach Sandeep with the additional DGP.

She has alleged that her coach didn't only assault her mentally and physically but also destroyed her career.

The weightlifter said in her complaint that Sandeep tried to assault her sexually and began to torture her as she objected to what he has been trying to do. He forced me to lift heavier weights during warm-up matches which affected her performance in the main match.

She claims that she took the matter to sports authority of India and also Indian weightlifting federation but no action was taken in this regard.

Sandeep, on the other hand, defended himself saying that he had not been her coach. He said that the weightlifter is like a daughter to him and he treats her same way. The allegations are baseless.
