Abuse
Description:
			Furious at being beaten up publicly by a minor for stalking her, a beggar attacked the 16-year-old girl with a sharp weapon near Chimnya Ganapati Chowk in Sadashiv Peth on Wednesday. The girl sustained minor injuries on her hands and belly.

Vishrambaug police arrested Devdas Bhimppa Marti, 45, under sections 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) of the Indian Penal Code and the relevant sections of the Protection Of Children from Sexual Offences Act.

Around 7 am, on October 17, the girl and her friends were walking towards their school when the suspect followed them and sang songs to draw their attention. "They ignored him, but when he continued to harass them, the girl turned to confront him," Mahendra Patil, sub-inspector of the Vishrambaug police station, said. Marti ran away but was chased and stopped by the girl near Mahatma Phule vegetable market. "She thrashed him, with help from the locals," Patil said.

Two days after the incident, the suspect again followed the girl. When she reached near Chimnya Ganapati Chowk, the suspect attacked her with a cutter and fled.

Patil said his team, including police constables Sharad Wakase, Baba Dangde and Anand Babar, collected CCTV footage from the spot. They tracked down the beggar and took him into custody. "Prima facie investigations revealed Marti assaulted the girl as he was angry after Monday's thrashing," he added.
