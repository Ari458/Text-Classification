Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			Two teenagers attempted suicide after allegedly being raped in the Mathabhanga subdivision of the State Cooch Behar district. While one of the girls (both students of Class 9) consumed pesticides and is fighting for life at the Cooch Behar district hospital, the other, who hung herself to the ceiling in her house, has died.

The incident occurred at the Belerdanga village under the Hazarhaat panchayat area of the district. The girls went out to visit Kali Puja pandals with two youths who were known to them. After they returned home on Saturday night, they told their parents and family members that they had been sexually assaulted by the youths.

Before the family members could do anything, one of them consumed pesticides on Saturday night. The second girl allegedly hung herself when the family members went to lodge a complaint on Sunday afternoon.
