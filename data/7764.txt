Description:
			An assistant sub inspector (ASI) posted at the Phase 8 police station was on Wednesday booked on charges of raping a 27-year-old woman who had approached him with a complaint against her husband.

The woman, a resident of Sector 68, has accused ASI Balbir Singh of repeatedly raping her for nearly a year.

In her complaint, the woman told the police that Balbir came to her house last year after she had filed a complaint against her husband. She said she served the policeman tea but he asked her to bring some snacks as well.

"When I went to get the parnathas (snacks), he put some intoxicants in the tea. After drinking the tea, I fell unconscious, and when I regained consciousness after more than an hour I realised that he had raped me," the woman alleged.

The complainant also alleged that the accused cop clicked her obscene pictures which he used to blackmail her sexually exploit her again and again.

"We have received a complaint from the woman following which a case has been registered. Investigations are on," said Ashish Kapoor, SP city, SAS Nagar.
