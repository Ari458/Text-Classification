Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A day after a 17-year-old schoolgirl was allegedly gang-raped by four youths, two of whom were arrested, the other two suspects are still at large.

The victim, a Class XII student, was abducted in a car and gang-raped near the Railway Colony in Mauli Jagran on Friday. She was returning from tuition classes when the incident took place. The four took turns to rape her. Later, they dropped her back home.

Guriqbal Singh Sidhu, ASP (East), said investigations were on and raids were being conducted to arrest the suspects. The suspects are residents of the area falling under Mani Majra, the ASP said. Police officials said the suspects were not known to the victim.

The ASP said the police had various leads and the remaining two suspects would be arrested soon.

The two suspects who have been arrested are Bansi and Chander Shekhar, a BTech student. The police have also conducted a search of the jungle area where the minor girl was allegedly raped. The police have recovered evidence in the form of contraceptives from bushes and have taken these in their possession.

Area residents demanded that the engineering wing of the UT Administration should ensure that the shrubs in the forest area near the Railway Colony, Mauli Jagran, were trimmed from time to time to check crime in these areas.
