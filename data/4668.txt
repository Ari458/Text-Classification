Abduction, Rape
Description:
			A man was arrested for allegedly kidnapping and raping a married woman to "settle scores" with her brother who was his estranged business partner.

Aleem Khan was apprehended yesterday on a tip off by the victim's brother.

Police said Khan allegedly wanted to take revenge on his estranged business partner who had chucked him out apparently for harbouring ill intentions against his sister.

"Khan and his partner were running a mobile phone shop in Anjangaon in Amravati district of neighbouring Maharashtra in partnership. However, Khan's partner discontinued their partnership after he came to know about Khan's amorous intentions," police said.

Khan allegedly kidnapped his partner's married sister by calling her at some place with the help of her friend on April 23.

"Khan then informed his partner that he had kidnapped the latter's sister and dared him to save her," police said.

According to police, Khan took the victim to Akola, Mumbai, Khandwa and repeatedly raped her at different hotels.

"He was also forcing her to marry him by changing her religion with the help of his close aides," police said.

However, the woman somehow managed to get in touch with her brother during captivity in Khandwa following which the latter alerted cops.

A police team raided the hotel and rescued the victim and arrested Khan.

The accused and the victim will be handed over to Anjangaon police for further action as the matter was registered there.
