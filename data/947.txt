			The accused, K. Deepak had the victim met for the first time at a seminar in Visakhapatnam and fell in love. They decided to get married.

What started as a suspicion after she told him that she used to move closely with a boy in school, soon created a rift between the couple. Notwithstanding the woman's requests, the accused started harassing the woman forcing her to drop the marriage plan. He then opened an account with Facebook in her name and posted their photos of private moments humiliating the woman. He sent the same to their common friends and circulated to others through different social websites.
