Foeticide/Infanticide
Description:
			Female foeticide was widely reported in Proddatur and Badvel areas. Kadapa district has 107 scanning centres and some of them concentrated merely on determining and disclosing the gender of the foetus, they said. They expressed concern that the figure stood at 919 women per 1,000 men in Kadapa district.

Jana Vignana Vedika launched a signature campaign at SKR and SKR Government College for Women at Nagarajupet here on Thursday demanding strict implementation of Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (Regulation and Prevention of Misuse) Act to meet out stringent punishment to those determining and disclosing the gender of the foetus in order to check female foeticide.
