Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A minor girl, who may have accidentally landed up in Delhi, was allegedly molested by one person and then raped by another. At the time of going to press, police had arrested the man accused of molestation, but the rapist is yet to be identified.

According to police, the 15-year-old girl, who hails from Bihar, was brought to the city by Mohammad Shamsher on January 18.

Shamsher, who works as a tailor in Udyog Vihar, had brought the child home from a visit to Delhi, and introduced her to his wife as someone he knew. But Shamsher's wife caught him molesting the child the next day. When confronted by his wife, he threw out the girl. She was then taken by another man to a nearby slum and raped the same day. She finally managed to reach Udyog Vihar police station and registered a complaint on Thursday.

"We've lodged an FIR against the accused duo. Shamsher, who is accused of molestation, has been arrested and will be produced in court on Friday. We're conducting raids to nab the other man, as yet unidentified," said inspector Sube Singh, SHO, Udyog Vihar police station.
