Description:
			The 28-year-old woman had gone to the railway station to buy tickets for Sadulpur, Rajasthan. Counter clerk Jamna Lal asked her for the exact amount. When the woman said she did not have the change, the clerk became infuriated and refused to issue her the tickets. The woman went to two other counters for the tickets and her request was turned down. When she protested verbally, three of counter clerks came out and molested and beat her up.
