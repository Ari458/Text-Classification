Street Harassment
Description:
			Since the Chandigarh Police started a campaign against those who are allegedly involved in attempting to outrage the modesty of women, the Police Control Room has been receiving five calls per day on average to report such cases.

Following the episode of Komal Kohli, the 19-year-old teenager who was beaten by three boys when she reacted to their mischievous acts, not only the Chandigarh Police but also the city residents seem to have become vigilant. The police had started the campaign on October 26.

Recently, two incidents of womens harassment were reported near Sector 40, Chandigarh. A foreign national was a victim in one of the incidents.

Deputy Superintendent of Police Roshan Lal, who is heading the Police Control Room (PCR), says, Sector 40 residents have written to us requesting to have an interaction with Senior Superintendent of Police Naunihal Singh. They want the SSP to give suggestions for safety from miscreants.

To make the women of Chandigarh aware of the special arrangements made by the Chandigarh Police to fight the menace, we are visiting schools and colleges to spread awareness. After the recent interaction with the IT professionals at the IT park, we will be visiting residential areas, added the DSP.

Since the campaign was started, the PCR has received 162 calls of women complaining about young boys and middle-aged men trying to cause harm to their dignity. Acting on these calls, 56 FIRs have been registered and 65 people have been booked on charges of outraging the modesty of women.

In addition to the lectures being delivered by the police, there are 10 squads of young police officers in the city that keep a check on such incidents near schools and colleges. The woman police officer in-charge of the campaign, Inspector Harjit Kaur, has been given video recordings of such incidents by local residents and victims.
