Description:
			In an incident similar to the call money case that rocked Andhra Pradesh, where borrowers were harassed by loan sharks, a financier in the city was arrested for allegedly harassing a woman borrower demanding exorbitant rate of interest. He allegedly refused to return five blank cheques and passport, which were deposited as security, till the loan was cleared.

A 21-year-old woman, Shaik Aliya, who is an employee at a beauty parlour took a loan of `6 lakh from Veera Subramaniam Reddy, a financier, a few months ago. He held back about `1.32 lakh and gave her `4.68 lakh as loan.

The loan was given at an exorbitant interest rate of 20% and was supposed to be returned in a month. Subramaniam took five blank cheques and passport as security for the loan. She reportedly agreed to pay `20,000 a day for a month. The woman was introduced to the financier, who lives in Ameerpet, by a friend.

However, failing to repay the loan within the stipulated time, Aliya told reporters that she was made to pay about `8.30 lakh over a three-month period. She alleged that the financier claimed that the `8.30 lakh was interest and she has yet to pay `6 lakh as principal amount.

The alleged harassment forced the woman to approach the police and lodge a complaint against the financier and his cousin Chinna. “The woman named Veera Subramaniam Reddy, and his cousin Chinna in the complaint. We have registered cases under IPC Section 384 (Punishment for extortion), and under Money Lending Act. The accused were arrested on Wednesday and produced before the court,” said SR Nagar SI S Ravi Kumar.
