Street Harassment
Description:
			Despite a strict campaign against sexual harassment in the city, crime against women continues unabated. On Friday night, two occupants of a Honda City bearing a Himachal VIP number chased and passed obscene remarks against two city girls near Aroma lightpoint in Sector 22. 

The incident took place around 1.30am when the girls stepped outside Aroma hotel. They got on to their two-wheeler but the youths started chasing them. The accused identified as Lavanya Puri of Shimla and Sandeep Gill of Mohali have been arrested, while the car they were in has been impounded. 

The car (HP-76-0003) belongs to the family of Lavanya Puri of Shimla, who is one of the accused. While Lavanya is the son of a Shimla-based contractor, co-accused Sandeep is a student of DAV College-10. 

Though Lavanya was driving the car, the person in whose name it was registered is yet to be ascertained. The two youths started chasing the girls from lightpoint. The girls objected to it near Piccadilly roundabout and also called PCR. Police said both the occupants of the car were nabbed between Aroma lightpoint and Piccadilly roundabout. Lavanya was staying in Sector 8.
