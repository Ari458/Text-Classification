Child Sexual Abuse, Rape, Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			The Khandeshwar police on Wednesday arrested the office-bearer of a children's shelter home in Panvel for allegedly sexually assaulting a 15-year-old inmate. The police have arrested the caretaker of the home for convenience.

Senior inspector Amar Desai said, "Uttam Ghuge, 59, the vice-president of the home, hailed from Lohegaon in Pune but resided at the staff quarters along with the other accused, Nadira Shaikh, 42, since 2002, when the institution was established. Fifteen girls studying in various standards, including some pursuing postgraduate degrees, are accommodated there, besides eight boys. The victim has been at the home since July 2015 following the death of her parents."

"The victim and her friend had gone to Ghuge's house to attend a puja ceremony around 9 pm on January 18. But the caretaker took her friend outside under some pretext so that the girl would be with Ghuge. He allegedly took her to his bedroom and sexually assaulted her. He threatened to repeat the act if she told anybody about it. Hence, she kept quiet that night. The next day, however, she revealed her ordeal to her room partner, who informed their teachers," Desai said.

The victim also narrated an incident when she had gone to stay at the home. She claimed that the accused had kissed her when she was alone watching TV. Thereafter, the teachers counselled the victim and convinced her not to lodge a police complaint.

The police have registered an FIR under Section 376 of the IPC for rape and under provisions of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act. The court remanded Ghuge to police custody till January 25, while Shaikh has been remanded to magisterial custody, Desai added.
