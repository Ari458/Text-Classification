Rape
Description:
			A 35-year-old woman went on an indefinite hunger strike at the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital (MGMGH) here on Monday demanding the arrest of a police inspector from Tirunelveli whom she alleged had raped her.

Parimala, 35, a resident of Indian Bank colony in K K Nagar, filed a complaint on Saturday at the All-Woman Police Station, Cantonment, against Murugesan, a police inspector from Tirunelveli, alleging that he had raped her.

Parimala and Murugesan were in a live-in relationship when the latter was serving in Trichy a few years ago. Parimala alleged in her complaint that Murugesan has cheated her of money and valuables when they were living together. The relationship between the two strained after Murugesan was transferred to Tirunelveli. On Saturday, Murugesan came to Parimala's residence and allegedly raped her.

Based on her complaint, police registered a case against Murugesan under Sections 417 (cheating) and 376 (rape) of IPC.

Hospital sources said medical tests on Parimala confirmed rape. Meanwhile, Murugesan absconded after he came to know of the case of rape registered against him.

Not satisfied with the action taken by the police, Parimala reportedly refused to consume food since she was admitted to the hospital on Saturday. "I did not eat anything till today (Monday) since the time I was admitted on Saturday. It is to insist the police to arrest Murugesan," Parimala told TOI.

Parimala said that she would continue her hunger strike in front of the office of the commissioner of police in Trichy after she get discharged from the hospital in a day or two until Murugesan was arrested.
