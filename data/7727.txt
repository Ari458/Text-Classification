Child Sexual Abuse, Molestation, Street Harassment
Description:
			A schoolgirl was sexually harassed and her brother and mother were thrashed by four accused while she was on her way to school on Tuesday morning near Derabassi.

All the accused are residents of Derabassi and two of them have been identified as Dalwinder Singh and Lovnish Singh; the other two are yet unknown.

Sources in police said the incident happened when the minor, a high school student, was headed to school along with her younger brother on an isolated road. The two had just left home when Dalwinder and Lovnish and the two other youths stopped them. They grabbed the girl's arm and shut her mouth. They then began touching her private parts and restrained her little brother from coming to her help. The kids' mother suddenly appeared with some stuff they had forgotten at home and ran to her daughter's rescue. The accused then thrashed the family and fled from the spot.

The victim's family approached the police and in her statement, the girl identified two of the youths. Her kin have complained that the accused also threatened them from filing a complaint.

An FIR has been lodged against the four under sections 354A (sexual harassment and punishment for sexual harassment), 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt) and 341 (Punishment for wrongful restraint) of the IPC.
