Child Sexual Abuse, Molestation
Description:
			A 50-year-old man has been booked by the Kuniyamuthur police for allegedly assaulting a 15-year-old boy who had refused to indulge in homosexual acts with him.

The victim’s father, who is the complainant, was working as a driver for the accused, Balasubramanian alias Ponnan, for the past three years. The family was also residing in a rented house belonging to Balasubramanian.

On Saturday, the boy’s father filed a complaint with the Kuniyamuthur police, alleging that Balasubramanian had beaten up his son, after the boy refused to indulge in homosexual acts with him.

He claimed that the accused approached his son on numerous occasions when he was alone at home and tried to force him to perform sexual acts on him.

The victim reportedly told police that Balasubramanian had been making sexual advances towards him since the June of 2013.

The police booked Balasubramanian under Sections 342 (wrongful confinement), 377 (unnatural offences), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 506(ii) (criminal intimidation) of the IPC.

They also booked him under various sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. Balasubramanian is said to be absconding.

Police are also verifying if the charges are true, as it is said that the victim’s father and the accused had a dispute over payment of salary.

They also suspect that the complainant, with the backing of a political party, could have fabricated the charges.
