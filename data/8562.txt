			A four-year-old-girl from Mankhurd was found raped and murdered early on Monday. This is the second incident of kidnap and rape in Mankhurd in a month. Last month, a five-year-old girl was kidnapped from Mankhurd, raped and abandoned in Dharavi.

The girl's parents, who sell peanuts, had filed a missing complaint on Sunday night.
