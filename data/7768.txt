Molestation, Murder, Street Harassment
Description:
			A woman in Bulandshahr was killed and her husband was critically injured when they opposed molestation of their daughter on Saturday.

Four youth tried to pull a 19-year-old girl inside their car in Baghwala locality under Debai police station. A passerby informed her mother Manju Singh over the phone about the incident. As she rushed to the spot, the molesters started beating her with sharp weapons. They also attacked her husband Preetam Singh, who is a teacher in SD Inter College in Debai. While Manju was declared brought dead at district hospital, Preetam is critically injured and undergoing treatment. The girl, who is an undergraduate student, said, "I had gone out to buy some items for Janmashtmi, when these four youths in a car passed lewd remarks. I ignored them. Then they tried to drag me inside their car. As I was trying to save myself, someone called my mother and informed her. Later my father also reached there."

The girl said she had never seen the four accused before in the area. The local people have alleged that Brahm Singh Yadav, Circle Officer of the area, was near the crime spot but did not take action. However, he claimed that manhunt was on to arrest the culprits.

Shockingly, five cases of rape or molestation were reported in Bulandashahar on Saturday. A supply inspector too filed a complaint and alleged that her District Supply Officer Dwarka Prasad Tripathi was trying to sexually harass her.
