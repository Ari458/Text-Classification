Description:
			A city based doctor was arrested for hacking the email of a woman and blackmailing her to disclose the Facebook Id password.

A 23-year-old woman professional was puzzled when she failed to log on to her email despite repeated attempts. She logged into her Facebook account and was shocked to see messages in the inbox sent from the profile of an unknown woman. In the messages she found her own photographs in the 'dropbox' along with a threat that the private photos would be made public if she doesn't reveal her Facebook profile password.

The woman sought help from her colleague who asked her to lodge a complaint with Women Power Line 1090. On receiving her complaint, cyber experts at the helpline traced the man harassing her and arrested the city-based doctor, a qualified MD.

The doctor told police he had hacked three e-mail IDs of the girl and was also using a hacked Facebook profile to blackmail her. The girl was disturbed and when he blackmailed her she agreed to meet him and discovered to her shock that the man was her college friend's fiance. The doctor had come across her profile while viewing his fiancee's friend list.

According to cops at powerline, most victims in such cases don't activate security features enabled by answering some random questions like birth date and favorite destinations and thus email often get hacked.

Radio maintenance officer at Women Power Line 1090 Kuwar Raghvendra said, "In most cases related to social media, the accused turns out to be a close one. To tackle the situation, password should be a combination of alpha numeric and special characters and not as easy as cell phone number, birthdates and vehicle numbers."
