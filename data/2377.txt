Description:
			A 20-year-old woman allegedly killed her seven-month-old daughter by banging her against an electric pole before she committed suicide by jumping before a speeding train here.

Some local residents yesterday saw the woman, Latabai Narayan Gawli, banging her infant daughter against an electric pole near a railway track on the outskirts of the Jalgaon railway station.

Seeing the people rushing towards her, Latabai threw the injured baby aside and jumped on the railway track where a train was speeding towards Bhusawal.

While the baby died on the spot, the woman was declared dead after she was rushed to the civil hospital.

Later, the deceased's husband, a resident of Shanipeth in Jalgaon, told police that she was mentally ill and because of this she had been sent to her parents' home a few months back.

Latabai's brother later filed a police complaint against her 52-year-old mother-in-law of mentally and physically torturing his sister, based on which she was detained.
