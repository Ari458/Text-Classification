Abuse
Description:
			A 25-year-old man was arrested on Friday for allegedly raping a minor girl and scalding her three-year-old sister with burning cigarette butts in their house in Ghaziabad on Wednesday afternoon.

The girls, eight and three years old, are daughters of the suspect's father's tenant, living on the first floor of his house in Ghaziabad, police said. They were alone and sleeping when they were assaulted. The girls' parents work as labourers, police said.

Neighbours got to know about the assault after the girls' parents confided in them. The neighbours alleged the accused, a drug addict, went to the girls' house when their parents were out for work. They claimed the man raped the elder girl and scalded her sister with cigarette butts, and threatened them with dire consequences if they told anyone about it.

"When the parents returned, they noticed that their younger daughter was writhing in pain. She told them what had happened after which they took her to hospital," said a neighbour, who did not wish to be named. The sisters are undergoing treatment.

Another neighbours said when they had initially tried informing the police about the assault, they tried to hush up the matter. "The police lodged the complaint after the doctors examined the sisters and reported the matter to them," the neighbour said.

SSP Dharmender Singh, however, refuted the allegations and said, "We had registered the case soon after the matter was reported to us. The accused had gone into hiding but we tracked him down and arrested him on Friday evening, from his own neighbourhood.

A case has been lodged against him under Section 375 (rape) of the IPC and POCSO Act. The girls are currently recuperating in a hospital in Delhi."
