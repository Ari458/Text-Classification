Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A four-year-old girl was sexually assaulted by her 28-year-old neighbour and dumped in a ditch in outer Delhi's Shahbad Dairy on Sunday evening. The child was admitted to a hospital with injuries to her private parts. The accused youth was arrested within hours of the incident, police said.

Around 5pm, the child was reported missing from outside her house in Bansali Patti colony. Her parents said that while they were looking for her and contemplating approaching the police, someone informed them about the girl lying in a ditch along the main road.

She was bleeding from her private parts.
Her parents rushed her to a government hospital in Rohini where doctors informed them that she had scratch and bike marks on her body.

In her statement, the child told counsellors that her neighbour Jubiad (28) gifted her a doll and took her to a room. He forced her to sit on his lap and then raped her repeatedly. He gagged the girl when she cried out in pain. When the child fell unconscious, he presumed that she had died and dumped her in the ditch.
Following this, the girl's family and residents gathered outside Jubaid's house and dragged him out. Police reached the colony while he was being thrashed and took him into custody.

Police said that they would counsel the girl once she is fit. Jubaid was produced before a magistrate and sent to jail. Cops said that the accused is a rickshaw driver, but mostly stayed at home. The girl's father is a building contractor while her mother is housewife.
