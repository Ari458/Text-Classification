Rape, Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			A 24-year-old woman was allegedly gang-raped at RG Kar Hospital late on Friday night by a hospital employee and his relative. The two accused liftman Masum Ali Khan and his cousin Haider Ali — have been nabbed. 

According to the complaint filed with Tallah police station, the woman had come from Berhampur on Friday evening to visit a relative admitted in the hospital. She could not find her and was standing near the surgical ward on the ground floor, seeking help from passersby, when Masum and Haider spotted her. The two accused lured her to an empty room after telling her that they would help her find the relative. They took turns raping her there, she alleges. 

After they fled, she staggered out crying. Some people saw her and helped her reach Tallah police station where she filed a complaint on Saturday morning. Police acted quickly. DC-north Subhankar Sinha personally led the investigation along with the entire Tallah force and technical help from the detective department. The only clue was that the survivor had mentioned a liftman as one of the accused. By evening, police identified the duo. "They have been charged under sections 376D (gang rape), 120B (criminal conspiracy), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 509 (act to outrage a woman's modesty).
