The priest, Omkar Balla Puranik from Raigad district, has been remanded in police custody till March 27.

The rape survivor works as an executive in a bank and was recently transferred from Nagpur to Pune. She is in the process of taking charge of her new post.

Puranik became friendly with the woman and regularly contacted her on her cellphone. On January 19 and 20, Puranik stayed in a five-star hotel in Pune. He allegedly raped the MBA professional in his room, promising to marry her.

The woman later found out that Puranik was already married and also had a daughter.

Two months after the incident, the woman registered a complaint against the priest. Puranik was arrested from his residence under sections of the Indian Penal Code.
