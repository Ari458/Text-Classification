Description:
			The Vikhroli police arrested a man for abetting the suicide of his wife, a cop. Sub-inspector Sumedha Chavan (28) was found hanging from the ceiling of her home. Her father had accused her husband Rakesh (34) of mental and physical harassment for dowry. 

A complaint in this regard was lodged in Vikhroli police station. The father of the deceased claimed that Rakesh, who works as a driver in a private company, was torturing Sumedha because he wanted a motorbike. The couple married six years ago and have a two-year-old son. 

Sumedha, a resident of Kannamwar Nagar in Vikhroli (E), left behind a suicide note saying nobody should be held responsible for her death.
