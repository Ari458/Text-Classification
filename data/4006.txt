Crime, Rape
Description:
			Four people, including two thieves, who posing as policemen allegedly gang-raped a 35-year-old widow have been arrested. 

Though the offence took place in the city on January 19, it came to light later when Pendurthi police nabbed the four accused in the case. 

The woman, a native of city's Pendurthi area, had lost her husband about two years back and was working at a shop for livelihood. 

On January 19 evening, the woman along with her friend S Naidu was walking towards her home where four people - K Ramana, P Ramesh and their friends A Vara Prasad and P Mahesh - posed as policemen before her. 

Later, two of them thrashed Naidu and tied his hands. The four then took turns to rape the woman in front of her friend. 

The four accused then warned the woman and Naidu not to inform police about the incident and fled from the spot. 

The victim approached Pendurthi police on January 23 and lodged a complaint. 

Based on the complaint and the information provided by the victim, a police team nabbed accused K Ramana. 

During the interrogation, Ramesh disclosed the names of three others accused in the crime who were arrested later.

All the four accused have been booked under section 376(D) of IPC. 

Both Ramana and Ramesh were involved in several theft cases in and around Pendurthi area, the ACP said.
