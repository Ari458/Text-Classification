Rape
Description:
			The victim was allegedly found naked and unconscious by passersby on November 28 minutes after she went to attend nature's call. "We had taken her to Capital Hospital and from there to SCB Medical College and Hospital after that. But we had to leave the hospital after a few days as we could not afford the treatment. She is still critically ill," said the victim's father.

It was not about treatment alone. Behera alleged that he had tried to lodge a complaint with police which initially did not receive it. Once the FIR was registered, no action was taken against the accused, Behera said.

The victim was a key witness to a molestation that had occurred in the area in January 2008 when she too was assaulted. The girl was receiving regular threats  since then while the case has gone on trial at Puri
