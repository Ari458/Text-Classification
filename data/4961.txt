Murder, Rape
Description:
			A rape survivor was allegedly murdered by the accused, who was out on bail.

The woman, a resident of Bhind district, died while undergoing treatment in Delhi on June 19. Her body was brought to Bhind on Thursday and post-mortem was conducted.

On April 1, the survivor filed a complaint at Dehat police station of the district that accused Rajiv Dubey, a resident of Virgawan village, exploited her sexually for more than one year on the pretext that he'd help her husband get a government job. When even after a year Dubey failed to get the husband a job, she filed the complaint, the survivor said.

Subsequently, Dubey was arrested and sent to jail and recently released on bail, said sources.

On Thursday, Parvat Singh, husband of survivor, brought her body from Delhi and alleged that on May 20, Dubey, who was out on bail, abducted his wife at gunpoint. Singh only came to know later that she had been taken to Auraiya in Uttar Pradesh, that's when he went there with his family. "In Auraiya, the survivor was found in a pitiable state and had been subjected to severe atrocities," Singh said.

Singh took her to Delhi for treatment where she died.

Singh has alleged that she died due to torture inflicted by Rajiv Dubey, said sources.

IG Chambal Range, D C Sagar said, "A case has been registered and investigations are on. It is only after investigations are over that things will be clear".
