Human Trafficking, Rape
Description:
			Thampanoor police on Monday arrested a 35-year-old man who was a key accused in a gang rape case registered by the city police a year ago. The police identified the accused as Sulaiman of Malappuram. 

Thampanoor circle inspector Suresh V Nair said that the accused was arrested in Mumbai a few days ago when he landed there after a lookout notice was issued in his name. 

The case against him was that he was part of a gang that allegedly raped a woman hailing from Parippally after taking her to Qatar offering her a job as domestic maid a year ago. On reaching Qatar, she was taken to a house located in an isolated place not far away from the airport, where she was kept in confinement and raped by several people for 10 days before she managed to escape with the help of another expatriate from the state. On returning, she filed a complaint before the city police commissioner H Venkatesh, based on which Thampanoor police registered a case. 

Another accused Rasheed, who had made the travel arrangements for taking the woman to Qatar with the help of a travel agency here, was arrested last year. 

A team led by Suresh V Nair and Thampanoor sub-inspector S Anil Kumar went to Mumbai and secured Sulaiman's custody. A transit warrant was secured from the Metropolitan magistrate in Mumbai following which he was brought here on Monday and his arrest was recorded. He was produced before the court and remanded in judicial custody.
