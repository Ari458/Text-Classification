Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			The Indo-Tibet Border Police ordered a probe into the alleged attempt by a jawan to rape a 10-year-old girl, after the victim's family stormed into the ITBP camp.

The accused, 25-year-old Siyachand, has since been removed from active duty and is in quarter guard - a lock up to hold soldiers charged with offences. If found guilty, action will be taken against him.

The inquiry was ordered after some schoolmates of the victim recognised Siyachand in an identification parade. They had often seen him near the school. 
While the details of the crime are still sketchy, reports said the girl, while running away from Siyachand, collapsed into the hands of passersby. 

Meanwhile, some ITBP officials said it was also possible that the girl fell unconscious due to some other reason and suggested that Siyachand might not have had any ill-intention.

ITBP has increased patrolling in the area to avoid any untoward incident.
