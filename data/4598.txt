Child Sexual Abuse, Molestation, Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			A child abuse scandal rocked a leading shelter home for destitute girls in the city on Monday, with the police booking its supervisor for sexually exploiting the inmates.

The FIR (first information report) against Manish Arora, the official at Bal Niketan, Sector 15, follows an internal probe conducted by the social welfare department director. The report indicted Arora and two women attendants, Manjeet Kaur and her senior Meena Sharma. The police did not book the two, but would probe whether they tried to hush up the matter that surfaced more than two weeks back.

On April 3, some of the girls residing at Bal Niketan called the child helpline number of Chandigarh police, leveling allegations of torture, sexual assault and intimidation against Arora. A written complaint was lodged at the public window at the police headquarters in Sector 9. In the complaint, the victims alleged Arora had been exploiting them for last many years and the two attendants were aware about the crime, but refused to act. Following the charges, an inquiry committee was constituted and a fact-finding probe completed. The report was sent to deputy commissioner Mohammed Shayin on April 16.

During the recording of their statements, the inmates said Arora used to sexually harass them. "The attendant, Manjeet Kaur, also accepted that she had received a complaint against Arora from Sharma but she did not take stern action, and issued a verbal warning to him," sources said.

According to the statements of victims, Arora used to hug them, touch their shoulders and pat them on their back making them feel "very uncomfortable". They also stated that Arora often used to visit their rooms when they were alone. However, Arora, during the inquiry, claimed he touched the inmates in a "fatherly manner".

The investigation was being conducted by sub-inspector (SI) Aarti Goyal.
