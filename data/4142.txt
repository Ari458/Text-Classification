Murder, Rape
Description:
			A young deaf and mute woman was allegedly raped and killed in Sonari police station area.

Identified as a resident of Nirmal Nagar, the victim was found lying in a pool of blood in an isolated area on Marine Drive when a rag-picker, who was passing by, noticed the body and called the locals. Police reached the spot later.

The 28-year-old victim had gone out of her house to relieve herself in the bushes when the tragedy struck her. The victim, who was deaf-and mute, couldn't scream for help when she was attacked.

It appears that she was first raped and later stoned to death. Investigation into the matter is on. Police are awaiting the autopsy report to add the anti-rape sections to the initial FIR.

Police have lodged a murder case, but are waiting for the post mortem report for confirmation (of rape).
