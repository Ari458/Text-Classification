Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A 50-year-old man was arrested by the Malwani police on Friday for sexually assaulting his underage daughter. 

The victim was going through the ordeal since January 2012. But her father had threatened her into silence, police said. 

The victim is a class VIII student who lives with her parents and two brothers in Malwani. Her father works as a daily wage labourer while her mother is a househelp. She also has an older sister who is married and lives separately. 

"The victim was being sexually assaulted whenever she was alone at home. Her father had threatened to harm her and her mother if she ever dared to complain," said an official from the Malwani police station. 

After the latest incident on September 20, the victim broke down in school. Her teachers quizzed her and then helped her approach the Malwani police and lodge a complaint. 

The victim was sent for a medical examination. An FIR was lodged on Friday and her father was arrested. 

Besides IPC, charges were slapped under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act. The accused was also sent for a medical examination.
