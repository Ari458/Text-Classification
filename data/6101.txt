Description:
			A man allegedly strangulated his 19-year-old wife with a telephone cord and then stabbed her to death at his workplace here today, police said.

The 22-year-old man later surrendered to police.

The victim hailed from Darjeeling and had fallen in love with him and moved to the city about three months ago, police said.

He immediately surrendered to Variety Hall Road police, just 100 metres from the office, even as a team of medical assistants, who rushed to the spot, found the woman dead, police said. L
