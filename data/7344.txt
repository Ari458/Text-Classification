Description:
			Fourteen-year-old girl Sona (name changed), who was rescued by the police and was kept in an NGO home in the city, was reportedly sexually assaulted by some staff. The girl complained the matter to the officials.

Sona, who was allegedly brought to the city from Bangladesh in a human trafficking case, was produced before the Child Welfare Committee (CWC). The CWC provided shelter to the girl at Childline Home. Later, she was shifted to Navajeevan Bala Bhavan. When the girl was produced before the CWC recently, she complained that the staff at Childline Home sexually harassed her. CCWC Chairman B. Nagesh Rao said that inquiry would be ordered into the charges.

Sona reportedly told the officials that another girl was also sexually harassed at the Childline Home. The 15-year-old girl suffered the harassment silently before her parents took her away from there , alleged Ms. Sona .

She told The Hindu that two persons behaved indecently with her at Childline Home.

When the staff harassed me constantly, I requested to shift me to another home. But, I was forced to stay there for three months, she said.

Sona told us about the sexual harassment . We instructed to shift the girl to another home, but the organisers did not follow the instructions , Mr. Nagesh Rao said.
