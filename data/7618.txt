Child Sexual Abuse, Molestation
Description:
			A 17-year-old girl, who had set herself ablaze over alleged sexual harassment at Kalbanjara village in Punjab's Sangrur district last Wednesday, died in a Chandigarh hospital on Tuesday. The girl had allegedly been sexually harassed by four boys. 

It is tough to believe that such an incident took place in our village. The police should arrest the culprits and ensure that justice is delivered to the victim's family, said village sarpanch Tarsem Singh. 

Meanwhile, the police said that they have arrested one of the four suspects in the case and have filed a case. The police had come under severe criticism for failing delaying in filing the FIR against the suspects. 

Lehragaga MLA Rajinder Kaur Bhattal said the incident was shocking. She also criticised the alleged delay on the part of police in registering a case in the matter.
