Description:
			Foreign women exhibitors have alleged that they have been subjected to eve-teasing despite tight security and a special team of women constables keeping vigil at IITF. 

Women say that men come to their stalls, pass lewd comments and make offending gestures. "They flock to our stalls in groups, though we have accessories only for women. Then they pass comments in Hindi which we don't comprehend. When we tell them to go away they make inappropriate gestures and laugh," said Nuntarat, from Bangkok.

"We are here till November 30 and despite facing such harassment, we do not want to complain as we will be asked to make rounds to the police station," Maprang Bongkochakorn, from Hongkonk.
