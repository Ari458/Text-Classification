Abduction, Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A 13-year-old girl was allegedly abducted in the dead of the night when she was sleeping beside her mother and taken to Haldwani in Uttarakhand, where she was confined and repeatedly raped by her kidnappers for three days. 

The incident occurred on July 15 in Fareedpur town area of Baheri tehsil in Bareilly district. The girl's father claimed that she was abducted at around 3:30am, but they noticed that she was missing only around 5am. 

They searched for her, but could not find her. Someone close to the family informed them that their daughter had been abducted by Shekhar and Sonu, relatives of their neighbours Noniram and Chetram. 

The girl's father claimed that he then got some "influential persons" to intervene in the matter, after which the survivor was dropped at a nearby village, three days after her abduction. 

Talking to TOI, the survivor's father said, "The accused confined my daughter in a house in Haldwani, where they gang raped her for 3 days. It was only after some influential people of the village and relatives intervened, that the abductors released her in nearby Shareef Nagar Ittaua village." 

Confirming the incident, Baheri circle officer Amar Singh said, "As per the investigations so far, the girl was enticed by abductors living in the neighbourhood and taken to Haldwani in Uttarakhand. There, the accused rented a house and raped her. The medical reports are yet to come but a case has been registered against all the four accused under IPC section 376 (rape) and POCSO Act."
