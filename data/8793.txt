Description:
			In a shocking incident, a mentally unstable man attacked his 27-year-old sister while she was asleep, gouged her eyes using his fingers and bit off her index finger. This incident was reported from Parori village under Dhaurahra police station in Kheri district on Tuesday midnight. Police have registered an FIR against the man under sections 326 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons or means) and 307 (attempt to murder) of Indian Penal Code on a complaint filed by his father on Wednesday morning.

Ramji Choudhary, station officer of Dhaurahra police station, told TOI, "We have registered an FIR against the 24-year-old man and arrested him. The woman was sent to the district hospital for medical treatment and there is no threat to her life, but she is unable to see. The accused is believed to be mentally unstable."

The victim was sleeping inside her room when her younger brother, Badlu Kumar, entered the room and attacked her. Before she could understand anything, Badlu gouged her eyes using his fingers and when she tried to push him away, he bit off her index finger. She was saved due to timely intervention of her father who came into the room hearing her cries.

This incident occurred around 1 am and local residents gathered outside their house after hearing screams of the woman. She was taken to a community health centre for primary treatment. The parents of the girl didn't want to file a complaint initially, but after the police arrived at the spot, a written complaint was given to them.

The woman was later sent to district health centre and an FIR was registered on Monday. A government doctor who examined her said she had no vision in both of her eyes, following which she was referred to an eye specialist.
