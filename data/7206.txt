Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			Two youths have been arrested on a charge of sexually abusing an eight-year-old girl at Avarendal in Tirupalaikudi police limits recently.

Police said that the parents of the girl, studying Class IV in a local school, were away for work when the youths took the girl to a house under construction and sexually assaulted her. The girl had just returned from school when the accused – Ranjith (20) and a 19-year-old youth – both school dropouts from the same village, committed the crime, the police said.

Acting on a complaint from the girl’s mother, Tiruvadanai All Women Police registered a case and arrested the two on Sunday.

On Monday, they were produced before a magistrate court and remanded in judicial custody.

Ranjith, who had been arrested earlier for abusing a school girl in the same area, came out of jail on bail only last week, and committed the crime the very next day after his release, the police added.
