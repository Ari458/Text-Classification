Murder
Description:
			In a tragic incident, Somnath Choudhari (35), resident of Mokapada in Surgana tehsil of the district, allegedly hanged himself last night having murdered his 20-year-old daughter.

According to the police, Chaudhary had arranged his daughter Pushpa's marriage, but she was opposed to the match.

Four day ago, in a fit of anger he murdered her and threw her body into a nearby reservoir.

The body was found floating on the water two days ago.

Somnath apparently feared arrest as the probe had started and therefore ended his own life.

Further probe is on.
