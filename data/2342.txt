Description:
			A 35-year-old woman, allegedly locked up in a room by her parents for about four years, was rescued by police from her residence in the city today.

Hemavathi, a graduate in Commerce, was found in a traumatised state when police visited the house after receiving a tip off.

She was lying on the floor looking unkempt and not even properly clothed.

She was later shifted to National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences for treatment.

Looking dazed, Hemavathi told reporters she felt unbearable hunger and got food sometimes.

Rebutting the allegations that his daughter had been illegally confined, Hemavathi's father Renukappa said she had a rheumatic problem but was not taking medicines.

Her brother Somashekar said Hemavathi was not under 'house arrest' and had health problems for which she had undergone treatment.
