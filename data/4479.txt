Abduction, Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A court in Chennai sentenced a 28-year-old man to 10 years rigorous imprisonment for kidnapping and raping a minor girl. 

According to the prosecution, on December 4, 2009, Murugan, 28, a resident of Tindivanam, kidnapped a 14-year-old girl, a Class IX student at a corporation school. When she reached the school, Murugan abducted her. He took her to Gingee town and illegally detained her for two days and raped her. 

The minor's mother filed a complaint with the Kolathur police, naming Murugan as the accused. Based on the complaint, police traced Murugan and arrested him. He was charged with Section 366 (A) (procuration of a minor girl) and section 376 (rape) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). 

Defence counsel claimed that it was a case of consensual sex. However, additional public prosecutor, Gowri Asokan said, "consent is immaterial for having sex with a minor." Further, the doctor's evidence had corroborated the incident of rape. 

Judge Meena Satheesh sentenced Murugan to 10 years imprisonment under section 366 (A) and 10 years for committing rape. Both the sentences would run concurrently. The court also slapped him with a fine of Rs 10,000.
