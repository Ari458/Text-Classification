Molestation, Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			A doctor has been arrested for sexually harassing a woman employee of an ayurvedic government dispensary he is in charge of.

The woman had recorded obscene calls of the doctor made on her mobile, besides, audio and video clippings and later produced it in front of police who, in turn, got it verified from a lab in Chandigarh.

The case against the doctor for sexually harassing and threatening the woman was registered after the tapes were found genuine in the laboratory report.

The accused R S Parihar, 55, has been taken into custody. The woman, 38, had initially reported the matter in 2012. But it took more than a year for the police to register the case.

The complainant, a widow stated that the accused would force her to stay back in the dispensary even after the rest of staff would be sent away.

The accused tried to harass the woman, who comes from Vidisha daily in every possible manner and asked her to take a house in Bhopal, of which he would pay the rent.

However, the woman endured this till the police registered a case.
