Description:
			A private school teacher was today arrested for allegedly raping his minor student in Barmer district in Rajasthan, police said today.

The victim, a 15-year-old girl and a Class IX student, alleged that she was raped by her teacher Thakraram (30) on Thursday at an isolated place in Sheo town, police said.

The accused threatened to fail her in exam if she disclosed the incident to anyone, SHO Sheo Babu Lal said.

The victim, however, narrated the incident to her family members yesterday following which an FIR was lodged against the teacher, who was later arrested.

Police said the medical examination of the girl has been conducted and the report was awaited.

"Primary investigation revealed that the accused teacher was pressurising her to become friends. When she complained against it to the school principal Jai Singh and another teacher, no action was taken against him," he said.

A separate FIR against the school principal and another teacher was also registered under section 354 of IPC.

"The rape accused has been arrested under section 376 of IPC and the medical examination of the victim has been conducted. The report is awaited," the SHO said.
