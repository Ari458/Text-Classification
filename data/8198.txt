Abduction, Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A standard X student, aged around 16 years, was allegedly gang-raped by her friends repeatedly on Saturday night after she was administered an intoxicating drink at a pub on Central Avenue. The girl, along with her mother, approached Imambada police on Sunday after she returned home on Sunday morning.

The rape survivor's complaint has led to the arrest of Shubham Divekar and Roshan Deshmukh, both aged 20 years, for their alleged role in savaging their friend. The cops have charged Divekar and Deshmukh with rape and kidnapping apart from sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. Divekar and Deshmukh earn livelihood by supplying material to pan kiosks.

Police said the rape survivor and her two male friends were from the same locality. Divekar was close to the girl for the last two years. She had often gone out with Divekar, but this was the first time she went to a pub. Deshmukh had accompanied Divekar and his girlfriend.

It's learnt that Divekar and Deshmukh took the rape survivor to the pub promising to return soon after enjoying for some time. During the course of their stay at the pub, Divekar and Deshmukh ensured the rape survivor consumed liquor and other intoxicating materials, leaving her in an almost unconscious state.

Police said that Divekar took the rape survivor to his house at Vakil Peth, where he exploited her sexually. Police also said that Deshmukh too was with the couple. She was taken to her residence by the friends in the morning.

The minor girl's family decided to approach police after she regained consciousness and narrated the entire incident.
