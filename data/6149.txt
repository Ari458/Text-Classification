Description:
			A two-month-old infant was allegedly kidnapped by an unidentified man from a pavement in the Pydhonie area of south Mumbai in the wee hours today, police said.

The parents of the baby boy are pavement dwellers on Nagdevi street and the incident took place when the couple was sleeping last night.

The accused, said to be a man walking with a limp, was accompanied by a woman, an infant and a boy aged between 10-12 years. Police said that the child was carried off when he was asleep.

On waking up this morning, the boy's mother, Savitri Bhoir (20), saw that her child was missing and immediately approached police.
