Description:
			The Victim, Geeta was married to Kanhalal about 12 years ago. 

Eye Witness Account of the Incident by Geeta's 11 yr old Daughter:
On the fateful day, Kanhalal returned home and had a heated verbal duel over his alleged illicit relationship with Geeta. Enraged over it, Kanhalal allegedly beat Geeta up. However, after some time, Geeta covered herself with a quilt and went to sleep.

Later in the night, Kanhalal along with his father Kareele, mother Vishun Devi, brother Deokinandan, sister Kalawati and brother-in-law Rajesh clogged Geeta's breath with the same quilt by pressing it hard on her face. Thereafter, the accused hanged Geeta from a bamboo rod by a sari in the verandah in a bid to make the case look like that of a suicide.
