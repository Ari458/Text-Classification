Molestation
Description:
			A 25-year-old dairy farmer from Dahanu in Palghar district has been arrested for allegedly groping a woman constable who was on duty. 

On Wednesday night, the accused, Malu Bharwad who is a resident of Savta village, had gone to Saravli coastal police chowky in Dahanu to enquire about a certain woman constable. At that time, the constable who is now a complainant in the groping case happened to be on duty there. She asked Bharwad why he was enquiring about her colleague's whereabouts. 

This led to an argument between this on-duty lady constable and Bharwad. The war of words snowballed into a scuffle between the two, according to the police complaint lodged at Dahanu police station. 

The complaint states that Bharwad allegedly ripped off the woman constable's uniform and also touched her inappropriately. 

Bharwad has been booked for molestation (section 354 of the Indian Penal Code) and for obstructing an on-duty government servant (sections 186 and 353). A court in Dahanu remanded the dairy farmer in police custody.
