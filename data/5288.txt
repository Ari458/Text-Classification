Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			The Pant Nagar police on Monday arrested a man for stalking a minor girl at Ramabai Colony in Ghatkopar (E). Sudhir Sonawane's (22) arrest also helped the police crack the August 9 rape case of a 13-year-old at P L Lokhande Marg in Tilak Nagar as the survivor has identified the sketch of the accused prepared by the police.

The police said Sonawane targeted minors living on the roadside or were alone at home in chawls. They suspect he has committed similar offences in the past. DCP (Zone VII) Vinay Rathod confirmed the arrest.

Sonawane was nabbed by a patrolling team on Monday night after the victim's mother alerted them that the accused was stalking her daughter. "Sonawane's modus operandi is unique. In both the Tilak Nagar and Pant Nagar cases, he posed as a cop," said inspector R P Kewale. Sonawane has confessed to committing the August 9 rape.
