Molestation, Rape
Description:
			Noting that it was the duty of every Indian citizen to ensure no harm is caused to international refugees in our country, a Delhi court on Tuesday sent a security guard to 10 years in jail for first raping, and on the next day, molesting a Burmese refugee in 2011.

The court observed that it wasn't just the legal duty but also "a moral duty", as "the prosecutrix had taken refuge in our country".

ASJ Sharma also imposed a fine of Rs 60,000 on 43-year-old Ranjeet Singh who is a resident of Vikaspuri.

According to police, on March 2, Singh had entered the refugee's house while her husband was away at work and raped her. Singh had left when the woman's 3-year-old boy had come home.

The next morning, Singh had gone to her again and molested her.

The woman, along with her husband, had then reported the matter to police.

Since the woman and her husband knew neither English nor Hindi, their statement was recorded in the court with the aid of an officer of Embassy of Union of Myanmar, who translated the evidence. The complaint too was registered through him.

During the trial, Singh had claimed that he was innocent and had been falsely implicated by the woman and the interpreter in an effort to extort money from him.
