Description:
			A 25-year-old security guard posted at a bank's ATM has been arrested on charges of raping a Class XII student and then forcing her to undergo an abortion. 

The 16-year-old girl had met the accused, Pintu alias Karan, about a year ago through her uncle. After initial exchanges, Pintu forcibly got into a physical relationship with the girl, eventually leading to the minor getting pregnant. The accused allegedly forced her to abort the fetus. 

Though the chain of events took place about seven months ago, it was reported at the Clement town police station only recently. After remaining depressed for a long time, the girl finally narrated her entire ordeal to her mother. Following this, her father lodged a complaint against Pintu. The accused, who hails from the Pauri Garhwal district, was booked under Section 313 and 376 (rape) of the IPC. 

IPC Section 313 considers causing miscarriage without the woman's consent a cognizable, non-compoundable and non-bailable offence, and can be punished with imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years and shall also be liable to fine. 

Meanwhile, the girl was taken to the Doon Hospital for the mandatory medical check up. The reports of the check-up are being awaited.
