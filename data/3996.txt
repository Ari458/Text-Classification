There was tension at Bankra in Howrah's Domjur after an 11-year-old class five student was found dead in a bush 60 feet from her home. The victim's throat was slit and tied to her torn clothes. The victim's father complained that his daughter was raped before murder. Police started a probe. The body was sent for postmortem. A team of forensic experts will also examine the spot where the body was found. No one has been arrested so far.

The father was not at home that evening and the mother too was at a religious programme in Tikiapara, about two kilometer from their home. The victim left home around 6 pm to watch a TV programme at the neighbours place with her sister. She left the neighbours home alone around 8.30 pm after which there was no trace of her. When her mother returned at 9.30 pm, she informed her father that their daughter was missing. They along with the neighbours searched around and found her body at 11.30 pm. Police are probing all possible angles to nab the culprits. They are waiting for the postmortem and forensic reports.
