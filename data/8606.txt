Molestation, Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			An Iraqi woman has alleged molestation at Fortis Hospital.

The case dates back to May when the victim, who is in her late 50s, was undergoing treatment for a neurological disorder at the hospital. The woman was sleeping in her private room when a staff member allegedly molested her. The victim did not lodge a complaint with the police then. But she later reported the matter to her embassy and the complaint was forwarded to the Ministry of External Affairs.

A case under Section 354A (sexual harassment) of the Indian Penal Code has been registered following a letter from the Ministry of External Affairs in this connection two days ago. No one has been named in the First Information Report, said Gurgaon Assistant Commissioner of Police Hawa Singh.
