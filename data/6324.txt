Murder, Foeticide/Infanticide
Description:
			Six persons have been arrested in connection with the killing of a newborn baby girl delivered by a 17-year-old tribal girl at a government hostel in Chhattisgarh's Koriya district, police said today.

As per preliminary investigation, the minor girl got pregnant after she was allegedly raped last year by a 23-year-old youth, Anil, from her native Salgaon Khurd village, Koriya Superintendent of Police B S Dhruv told PTI.

After the girl delivered the baby at the pre-metric hostel in Ramgarh block of Koriya on January 2, the hostel superintendent - Kiran Kispotta - allegedly strangulated the infant to death to cover up the matter, he said.

Later, Kiran went to Salgaon Khurd and informed both Anil and the girl's family members about the matter following which they buried the infant's body near a river on the village outskirts, the SP said.

On getting information about the offence, the buried body of the newborn was exhumed near the river in the girl's native village, Dhruv said.

Six persons, including Anil, his and the minor girl's relatives, were arrested on Tuesday in this connection.

The hostel superintendent Kiran and her husband Phoolsai were still at large, he said adding that efforts were on to nab them.

Further probe was on in this connection, he added.
