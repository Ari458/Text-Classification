Molestation
Description:
			A 24-year-old woman has second time filed a police complaint against the same youth who has been troubling her for past few months. Kalamna police booked Praveen Zade, a resident of Bharatwada for the second time on molestation charges. In the first complaint, the woman had claimed that Zade would stalk her and pass indecent comments on her. However, Zade still continued his acts. On Sunday, Zade misbehaved with the woman again. The woman complained about Zade to his mother and sister-in-law who in turn argued with her and thrashed her. In her second complaint, police booked Zade's mother Vachhla and sister-in-law Kamla.
