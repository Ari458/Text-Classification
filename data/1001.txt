Description:
			The 37 yr old accused posed as the Chief Minister's security officer and went to the girls' house and brought her and her parents to Chennai, with the promise of getting financial aid for the 16-year-old girl. He had read about the scheme in the newspaper.

On December 18, he told the girl's parents that he was taking her along to meet the state education minister. As neither the girl nor Kannan showed up, the girl's father lodged a police complaint later in the day.
