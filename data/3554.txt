Murder
Description:
			The body of an unidentified young woman was found in a locked trunk outside Anand Vihar metro station in east Delhi.

The incident came to light when some passers-by noticed an unclaimed blue iron box right outside the metro station, following which the police were informed.

Police broke open the trunk to find body of a young woman stuffed inside.

The woman appears to be around 25-year-old. Although there was no visible injury marks on her body, there were marks of strangulation on her neck. It seems she was strangled and then her body was stuffed in the box.

Although police could not establish the identity of the woman as no documents were found from the trunk, they claimed there were some clues which can lead to her identification.

There was PK tattooed on her right arm and she was wearing a black and yellow salwar-kameez. She was also wearing a 'mangalsutra' and bangles in both of her hands. There also was a line of vermillion on her head suggesting she was married.

As the body was not in a decomposed state, police are assuming that she was either killed the night before or in the morning. However, the time of death will only be confirmed after post-mortem.

The official said it was quite possible that she was murdered somewhere else and her body dumped near the metro station in a bid to mislead the police.

A CCTV camera is installed outside the metro station facing the spot where the trunk was found and police are scanning the footage of the camera to identify the people who left the box there.
