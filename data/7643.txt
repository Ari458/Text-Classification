Dowry Harassment
Description:
			The Mahila Court in Udhagamandalam on Thursday convicted and sentenced Suresh (29) to undergo seven years rigorous imprisonment in a dowry harassment case, wherein his wife had committed suicide.

According to the prosecution, Suresh of Nilakottai near Gudalur married Sangeetha of Karur on June 1, 2012, and it was stated that a little over 4 sovereigns of gold jewellery for Sangeetha besides six sovereigns for Suresh were given as dowry.

The prosecution accused Suresh of planning for overseas employment for which he had harassed Sangeetha demanding money and jewellery.

On July 12, 2012, Suresh is said to have informed Sangeetha's parents that she had immolated herself and that she had been admitted to Gudalur Government Hospital.

Her parents reached the hospital only to find that Sangeetha had succumbed to burns.

They preferred a complaint with the Gudalur police stating that Suresh, his parents Krishnan and Manimegalai were responsible for the death of Sangeetha.

Based on the complaint, a case was registered and investigation began.

Holding Suresh guilty of dowry harassment forcing his wife to take the extreme step, Judge of the Mahila Court Sarvamangala sentenced him to seven years rigorous imprisonment, besides imposing a fine of Rs. 5,000 on him.

The judge acquitted his parents stating that they had no role in the incident.
