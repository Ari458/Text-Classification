Description:
			The police on Tuesday arrested three women in connection with a brutal assault on a woman in a south Tripura town on Monday.

A mob dragged the woman out of her home at Subhasnagar in Belonia, tied her to a tree, stripped her, cut her hair and beat her mercilessly. The mob, led by the main accused Sumitra Das, alleged that the mother of a 12-year-old son was indulging in moral turpitude. She had been staying in the locality since her husband deserted her.

The police reached the spot on information and freed her. As the police took no immediate action, she was attacked again in the night by the same mob. But she managed to run to the police station and filed a complaint against the attackers.

The police arrested Sumitra Das, Khukumani Das and Archana Das under Sections 354, 395, 342, 325, 451 and 506 of the IPC.

The police said some accused named in the FIR were at large.
