Description:
			In a shocking incident, a 29 year old married woman of Jhinkiria village under Sadar police station was allegedly gangraped by four men.
The woman lodged a complaint in this connection at Sadar police station on Wednesday alleging that at around 2am, four miscreants barged into her house, looted her and also gang-raped her. The woman claimed that the miscreants had entered her house with sharp weapons and their faces covered. At the time of incident, her husband was not present in the house.

"The miscreants held my two kids, three year old son and seven year old daughter, on knife point and threatened me not to raise alarm. Both my children were sleeping and I stood silent as lives of my children were in danger. The miscreants robbed my house and gagged me. Later, they forcibly took me to the river bed, located around 1.5 km away from my house, and gangraped me," said the woman. "The four miscreants also beat me black and blue and tried to kill me. But taking advantage of the dark night, I escaped and took shelter under a tree. In the morning I returned back and narrated my ordeal to my husband," said the rape survivor. The woman's husband works as an insurance agent and also owns a shop in the village. On Tuesday night, he had gone to a private hospital in Cuttack to visit an ailing relative.

As per the complaint, miscreants have looted gold mangalsutra, silver anklets and around Rs 15000 cash from the woman's house. After receiving the complaint, DCP Sanjeev Arora and senior police officials visited the spot. Even medical examination of the rape survivor was also conducted. "We have started probe in the case," said Arora. Police suspects the miscreants entered the house by jumping the wall and the crime was committed by some local persons, who were well aware about the whereabouts of the woman's husband.
