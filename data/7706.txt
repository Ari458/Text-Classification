			The city police have booked a person for attempt to rape at Dehlon area here today.
The accused has been identified as Mohinder Singh (55), a resident of Dehlon village.

In her complaint at Dehlon Police Station, the 34-year-old victim said a month ago when she had gone to pick her daughter from school at 1:45 pm the accused, who resided in the same village, called her to visit his home.

She obliged and went inside to listen to what he had to say.

She said Mohinder tried raping her to which she opposed, as a result he threatened her saying that he would kill her.

She got scared and kept mum for a few days. She then finally told her husband about the incident, who then brought the case to the notice of the village panchayat.

Harjit Singh, Investigating Officer, said The women sought the panchayat's help for justice. But it, too, failed to satisfy her. The victim then came to the police station and complained.
