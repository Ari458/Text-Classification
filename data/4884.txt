Rape
Description:
			Mangesh Golhar has been charged with rape and cheating by MIDC police after his former girlfriend approached the cops on Friday. Samidha (name changed), eight month pregnant, has been admitted to Mayo Hospital with complications after cops took her for medical examination to confirm the rape.

It's learnt that Samidha, who had migrated to Nagpur from Madhya Pradesh in 2011, was working as a cook when she met Golhar through an acquaintance. Though Golhar wanted to have an intimate relationship, Samidha initially tried to avoid his advances but later fell in the trap as he lured her with the promise of marriage.

Police said Golhar approached Samidha on June 17 last year and tried to be intimate with her. Golhar later brought Samidha to his rented room at Gadge Nagar, where he coaxed her to have sexual relations with the promise of marriage.

Police said Samidha stayed with Golhar at his rented room for a couple of months. In that period, Golhar bought another woman to his rented room and introduced her as his sister-in-law. However, Samidha later caught Golhar cheating her with the other woman.

At this point, Samidha started persuading Golhar to marry her as she was carrying their child. Initially Golhar tried to convince her to abort the child, but kept on deferring the marriage. On May 29 this year, Golhar sneaked away from his rented room leaving Samidha alone.

Police said Samidha had come to the police station earlier too but no offence was registered. The cops booked Golhar after Samidha approached them the second time.
