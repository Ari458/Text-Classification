Rape
Description:
			A four-year-old girl was allegedly sexually harassed by her school bus crew, who have since been arrested on a complaint by her parents.

The two crew members - conductor-cum attendants-- of the school bus took the girl in an autorickshaw from school to her house telling her she had missed the vehicle. She was allegedly "sexually harassed" before being dropped home.

The girl's parents after being told about it by her tried to lodge a complaint with school management but in vain and then contacted Udupi legislator Pramod Madhwaraj.

The legislator asked the parents to lodge a police complaint which they did, leading to the arrest of both men -one aged 21 and the other 46.
