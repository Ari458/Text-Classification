Dowry Harassment, Abuse
Description:
			The police has arrested a UAE national who had married an old city woman, allegedly with the help of a qazi, for harassing her and demanding `1 lakh as dowry from her family.

Police said a qazi named Ali Abdullah Rifai approached one Mohammed Shamsuddin in 2009 with a proposal for his daughter's marriage with the UAE national. Mr Shamsuddin was promised that Mr Alnaqbi would organise a passport for the woman and take her to Dubai.

Mr Shamsuddin fell for the assurance and got his daughter married to the UAE citizen in June 2009. However, after the marriage, the accused left India within a few days, promising his new wife that he would return soon and take her to Dubai.

Inspector Moinuddin said the accused came to India on a few occasions since, and harassed the victim but never took her to Dubai.
