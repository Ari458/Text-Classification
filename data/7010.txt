Molestation
Description:
			Police have arrested a con artiste who was trying to sexually exploit unemployed women by promising them beautician jobs. The Bowenpally police on Tuesday arrested Syed Saleem, 35, from Samathanagar in Bowenpally. Saleem has been posting advertisements on various classifieds portals saying that he could provide employment opportunities to beauticians.

On seeing one of these ads posted by Saleem, the victim, a 25-year-old beautician from Yellareddyguda along with her beautician friend, contacted him over the phone on Monday. Saleem then asked the two to come to his office at Samathanagar for an interview by claiming that he could find them a job at a beauty parlour in Punjagutta with a monthly salary of Rs 12,000. When the two women went to Saleem's house on Monday, he asked one of them to wait in the hall and took the other inside the room to conduct an 'interview'.

After entering the room, Saleem asked the victim if she knew how to conduct aroma therapy and when she replied in the negative, he volunteered to teach her on the spot. "Saleem asked the victim to remove her top and then forced her to wear an apron which was open in the front. He then started massaging her and unable to bear the humiliation, the victim escaped from the place and lodged a complaint with us along with her friend," Bowenpally inspector K Kiran said.
