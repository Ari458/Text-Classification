Rape
Description:
			A complaint was lodged on Tuesday by a 30-year-old woman claiming that her father forced her into having a sexual relationship with him. "She claims that she has two children, a 3-year-old and another 6-year-old, with his father and that he has been sexually assaulting her for the past 7-8 years. According to her, her father used to return home in a drunken state and then beat her and her mother. She has now registered a case with help of her brother who had left the house a few years ago," said a senior police official.

"The father, a driver who is about 58 years old, is absconding. He lives in Shankar Vihar with his family. Medical investigations will be carried out to reveal the truth," he said.
