My husband beat me again. This time for heating water to take bath. I told him that I was sorry for using the geyser for few minutes more. But he did not listen. He dragged me out of the bathroom and thrashed me in front of mother in-law, sister in-law and even grown up children. My father in law also supported my husband. He said that no one will save me, Shushrutha's message to her brother reads. 

Her seven-year-old son told the police that his father dragged her out of the bathroom naked and beat her. 

Shortly after receiving the message, Shushrutha's family living in Suryapet in Nalgonda district tried calling her but did not get a response. They were later informed that she hung herself from the ceiling fan of her bedroom. 

No suicide note was found, but police registered a case against Mohan under Sections 306 (abetment to commit suicide) and 498-a (subjecting married woman to cruelty) of the IPC and Sections 3, 4, 6 of the DP Act based on a complaint by her family members.

Sushrutha's parents allege that hot water was poured on her and have urged the police to register a case of murder against Mohan. They have also refused to take her body to Suryapet, saying the in-laws must perform the last rites as per the tradition.
