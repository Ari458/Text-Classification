Child Sexual Abuse, Rape, Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			Constable Anil Kumar, posted as a house guard at the official residence of Madhubani DM Giribar Dayal Singh, was suspended on Sunday for allegedly raping a minor girl.

Madhubani SP Akhtar Hussain said the constable, along with two others, allegedly entered the house of 15-year-old Rubi Khatoon (name changed) in Ganga Sagar locality of the town on Saturday evening, sprinkled some chemical on her face and made her senseless. Then they took her to a nearby field and gang-raped her. The girl hails from an economically weak family and was at home alone at that time.

"Later, the constable and his accomplices admitted the girl to Sadar hospital in an unconscious state that night. When she recovered her senses on Sunday morning, the survivor narrated the incident to the police," said the SP, adding that the girl could not identify the two other accused who had accompanied the constable. The girl's house is not very far from the DM's residence and she had seen the constable many times in the past.

The SP said the constable, who is absconding, has already been suspended and a special investigating team has been formed to nab the culprits. "Police are searching for the constable and his two accomplices," said the SP.
