Domestic Violence, Dowry Harassment
Description:
			A NIFT, Kangra, professor has been arrested by Gurgaon Police on charges of demanding dowry from his wife and threatening to kill the woman, her daughter and her father. A city court granted the professor, Neeraj Jaiswal, bail on Wednesday.

The professor's wife, Pampa Jaiswal, a teacher at a private school in the city, had lodged a complaint in Sector 18 police station earlier this month, accusing him of having an extra-marital affair and harassing her physically, mentally and financially. The couple have a 15-month-old daughter but Pampa alleged her husband hadn't called her for the last eight months or sent her money.

On May 1, Pampa, a teacher in a private school in Gurgaon, lodged a complaint against her husband at the Sector 18 police station accusing him of harassing her mentally and physically. In her complaint (a copy of which is with TOI), she also alleged that he had an affair with a colleague and neglected their daughter, not sending any money for the family's needs in the last eight months.

She claimed that after she had called him several times, he had replied through an SMS in which he allegedly threatened to kill their daughter and the woman's elderly father. It was after this that she decided to approach the police.

"I have been quiet all this while. He had harassed me only to spend time with another women. I bore that but I will not accept him not giving me any penny for the child," she said.
