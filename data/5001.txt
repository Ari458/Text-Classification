Molestation
Description:
			A man, accused of molesting and wrongfully confining his sister-in-law here, has been granted anticipatory bail by a Delhi court. 

Additional Sessions Judge Virender Kumar Goyal granted bail to the Delhi-resident who, along with one of his brothers is an accused in the case, on a personal bond of Rs 25,000 with one surety of the like amount. 

"...In the event of arrest, applicant/accused be admitted to bail on furnishing a personal bond in the sum of Rs 25,000 with one surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the IO/SHO concerned. The applicant/accused is also directed to join the investigation as and when required," the court said. 

Earlier, the brother of the accused was given relief by another court which had directed the investigating officer to give seven working days notice to the co-accused if he was required to be arrested in the case. 

Advocate Amit Sahni, who appeared for the accused, sought bail contending that his client was falsely implicated in the case as there was a property dispute in the family. 

Sahni also argued that the role of his client was "lesser" than the co-accused who was given protection from arrest by the court. 

The police, however, opposed the bail plea alleging the complainant, sister-in-law of the accused, was still being threatened that she would be killed if she does not withdraw the case. 

The police, in its FIR, had claimed that the accused had molested his sister-in-law on May 27 last year at their residence here. 

The complainant had also alleged that on May 11 last year when she was alone in her house along with her minor daughter, her brother-in-law, co-accused in the case, had tried to rape her but the matter was settled.
