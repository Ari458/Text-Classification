Dowry Harassment
Description:
			A woman constable posted at the Bareilly Mahila Thana, in a complaint to senior cops, has accused her husband and brother-in-law of demanding dowry of Rs 10 lakh. The constable alleged that the two, along with her sister-in-law, threatened to putt her objectionable photographs on city walls. 

An FIR has been lodged against her husband and his brother. In her complaint, the woman constable said that she got married to Dhirendra, a resident of village Neplapur under Sitapur district on May 25, 2012. After she had a baby in 2013, her brother-in-law asked her to deposit Rs 5,000 every month in her husband's account to take care of the monthly family expenses. She continued to deposit the amount, said SP (city) Rajeev Malhotra. 

Then her husband's elder brother, Upendra, asked her to give Rs 10 lakh and started harassing her. He would also come to Bareilly along with his wife and publicly insult the victim. The victim alleged that when she expressed her inability to arrange the huge sum, the two reportedly threatened to malign her reputation by putting up her photographs all over the city. The victim immediately brought the matter to the notice of senior police officials on whose instructions an FIR under Section 498A of IPC was lodged at the Mahila Thana against her husband and his brother. 

Malhotra said, "The matter has been referred to the Family Counselling Center at Police Lines for the next two months where the two families, with the help of family counselors would be asked to work out a settlement. Failure to do so would result in police action against the guilty person after which the issue would be taken up in court."
