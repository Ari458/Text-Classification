			A court has sentenced a 63-year-old man to 7 years in jail for raping a 15-year-old girl in Muzaffarnagar district.

Additional District Sessions Judge Jaishri Ahuja yesterday imposed a fine of Rs 10,000 on the accused, Sitaram, after holding him guilty under section 376 of the IPC.

According to prosecution, Sitaram raped the minor girl, who was also his neighbor, at Khedki village on September 17, 2011.
