Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A 40-year-old man was arrested here today on charges of sexually assaulting and impregnating a minor girl student in Periyanaicken Palayam on the outskirts of the city some six months ago.

The 14-year-old school going girl was staying with her father, a daily wage labourer, who had separated from his wife following some differences.

The matter came to light when the woman's friend, who was asked to keep an eye on her,informed her that her daughter had started vomiting following which the lady came to the house, took her to a doctor, who confirmed she was pregnant.

After much persuasion the girl said her neighbour had entered the house while her father was away and raped her after showing her nude photographs of herself, which he had captured on his mobile phone.
