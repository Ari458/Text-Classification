Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			In yet another case of sexual harassment of women at workplace, a staff nurse has pressed molestation charges against the principal of government ayurvedic college . 

The complaint said the principal made obscene gestures, sent vulgar messages and transferred the nurse when she strongly objected to his advances. A district committee empowered to hear such complaints has submitted its report finding the charges to be true. 

Strangely, despite a clear cut instructions from the Supreme Court under the Vishakha guidelines, the accused principal is still holding the chair. Upon a written complaint from the victim to the home minister, the police has also began an investigation. 

Kirti Sharma, a 45-year-old staff nurse posted at the research center of the college said in her complaint that she had been facing harassment at the hands of Gauri Shankar Indoria, prinicipal of Madan Mohan Malviya govt ayurvedic college here for more than one-and-a-half years now. 

Earlier, she had been posted at the college campus and had been in-charge of the Panch Karma department of the college. Indoria, whom she claimed to be a man of low morals, was in the habit of making nasty remarks on her appearance. He used to visit her department often and asked her for a body massage. 

Tired of the continuous harassment, Sharma registered her case with the district complaint committee for prevention of sexual harassment of women at workplace in January.
