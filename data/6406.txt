Description:
			A local court has sentenced a youth to ten years of imprisonment for raping an eight-year-old girl at a village in the district.

Anantapur fast track court judge B Sunitah found 20-year-old Siddartha Reddy guilty of rape and kidnapping yesterday and also slapped a fine of Rs 22,000 on him.

According to prosecution, on August 4, 2012, Reddy lured the girl, who was playing near a temple in Pennavandla Palli of the district's Talupula mandal, with a fruit and raped her.

Later, he also threatened her with dire consequences if she revealed the offence to anyone.

The offence came to light when the girl, who lived with her grandmother, fell sick and was taken to hospital.

The victim's grandmother then lodged a complaint with police who investigated the matter and arrested Reddy.

The prosecution examined nearly 10 witnesses, including the minor girl, in connection with the case.
