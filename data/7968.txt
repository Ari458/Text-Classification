Domestic Violence, Dowry Harassment
Description:
			A Delhi court has dismissed a dowry death case, stating that “the deceased committed suicide in which the accused (her husband and other accused) had no role to play.”

The Kanjhawala police in North-West Delhi had also arrayed the parents of the victim’s as accused in the case, charge sheeting all of them under Section 498A (harassment for dowry) and 304B (dowry death) of the Indian Penal Code.

The court acquitted all the three accused, declaring the evidence by the parents and brother and sister of the victim as unreliable.

The victim had committed suicide by hanging at her matrimonial home within seven years of her marriage.

Her husband had also earlier stabbed her when she refused to cook meat. Though she had lodged a complaint in the Crime Against Women (CAW) Cell, they later settled the matter and started living together.

Dismissing the prosecution case, the court said the prosecution has miserably failed to prove that the accused ever treated the deceased with cruelty within the meaning of Section 498A IPC
