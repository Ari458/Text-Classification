Street Harassment
Description:
			Sitaramdera businessman and father of a 19-year-old girl R.K. Singh said he never lets his daughter go out alone in the evening, but rued that the situation is so bad that even company does not guarantee safety. 

On Sunday, my daughter and I went to buy medicines for my ailing wife. We had to head towards Lifeline Nursing Home in Sakchi because we did not find the prescribed pills at Sitaramdera. It must have been around 9.30pm. I noticed a middle-aged man staring at my daughter near the nursing home for quite some time, the 54-year-old recalled.

As the father-daughter duo left Sakchi, the man started following Singh's two-wheeler on his bike. We were close to home, when I decided to stop and confront him. When I asked why he was following us, the man turned abusive. He was drunk and also threatened to beat me up, Singh said.
