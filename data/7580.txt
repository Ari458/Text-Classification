Molestation, Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			Udann, a popular telly show on Colors Tv has gained immense popularity over little Chakor’s journey towards freedom. Bhaiyyaji aka Kamalnarayan Rajvanshi’s character in the show is also loved by everyone. You might love Sai Ballal for playing his negative role in the show so well. But, soon you might start hating this man. Yes, you got that right this veteran actor has been booked for sexually harassing a female co-star from the show.

Yes, Sai Ballal has been arrested by Mumbai Police for molesting an actress from the show. The senior actor has been harassing her since April 2015 and hence has been booked under IPC  (Indian Penal Code) Section 354-A (sexual harassment), 354-B (assault or use of criminal force to woman with intent to disrobe her) and section 67-A of the IT Act.

Ballal used to send porn videos and obscene video messages to the victim and has molested her several times. In order to put an end to his misdemeanour, she complained about his behaviour to the production house. The production house instead of helping her, threw her out of their telly soap. Hence, she decided to  approach Cine and TV Artistes’ Association (CINTAA) with her agony. The association probed into the matter immediately and identified the act as a criminal offence. 

The victim then lodged a complaint against Sai Ballal at Borivali Police Station on Wednesday. As per her complaint, the actor was arrested on the same day. He will be produced on court on Thursday for trail.
