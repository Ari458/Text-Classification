Description:
			A man and his siblings have been booked on abduction charges by the Samata Nagar police after they tied up his wife, forced her into a tempo and drove away with her on Friday.

neighbours said that Shashikala suspected her husband of having an affair with Ghanshyam's wife, Seema. The two quarreled several times over this issue. Rajaram decided to send his wife to her hometown, but she refused to leave their Kandivli home.

Around 8.45pm on Friday, Rajaram and his brothers tied Shashikala's hands and feet with a cord and gagged her, bundled her into a tempo and left the colony.
