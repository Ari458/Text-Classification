Rape
Description:
			In June 2011, sonu (18) came to the house of 5 month old infant's maternal grandmother and took her away with him saying he would leave her at her own house with her mother. After an hour, he left a bitterly crying child in custody of her grandmother as her mother had gone to market at that time, police said.

When the child's mother came and took her in lap, she noticed that the infant was crying and bleeding profusely.

The infant aged five months in the case was a soft and vulnerable target. The Accused Sonu has taken advantage of a helpless and defenceless child who could not even try to escape or express herself and was an easy and vulnerable prey.

"She must have undergone immense physical pain and agony when the offence was committed. In spite of the tender age of the infant, the convict went on to commit the ghastly, abominable, inhuman and barbaric act of rape, violating the person of the infant and giving a lifelong trauma to her family," said the court.
