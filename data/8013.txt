Domestic Violence, Dowry Harassment
Description:
			A 21-year-old home maker allegedly committed suicide by hanging herself from a ceiling fan at Santhapalem area of Chinagadili in the city late Sunday night. The deceased has been identified as B Lakshmi (21), a resident of the city. She reportedly took the extreme step as she was being harassed by her husband and in-laws for additional dowry.

According to Arilova inspector Ch Dhanunjaya Naidu, around six months ago, Lakshmi married B Sreenu, who is working as a sales executive for Fair & Lovely Company in the city. Though Lakshmi's parents had given the demanded amount of dowry at the time of the marriage, Sreenu and his parents have been harassing Lakshmi for additional dowry ever since they got married. Unable to bear the torture anymore, Lakshmi committed suicide by hanging herself.

Meanwhile, Lakshmi's family members lodged a complaint with Arilova police, alleging that Lakshmi has been murdered and that she would not have taken such a step by herself. Arilova police took Sreenu into custody. Investigation is on.
