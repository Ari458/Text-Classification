Description:
			A traffic sub-inspector along with his two aides allegedly stopped a young couple riding a motorcycle on the pretext of checking their vehicle documents, thrashed the youth and forcibly dumped the girl into a SUV and sped away. 

Responding quickly, the youth informed the girl's family about it before he decided to trail the SUV, which by then had disappeared from his sight. However, thanks to the heavy traffic jam at Jajmau bridge, the youth managed to spot the SUV stranded in the middle of the road and informed the local Chakeri police, who reacted swiftly and swooped down on the SUV. 

The girl said that the cops were trying to outrage her modesty, when she jumped off the speeding SUV and was escorted to the police station by a local lawyer.
