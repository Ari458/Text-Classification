Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			The Thoppumpady police arrested a 46-year-old man for allegedly raping his minor stepdaughter. The victim walked into the police station with a relative to report the abuse.

The accused was arrested from Fort Kochi based on the minor's complaint. The 17-year-old, in her complaint, said that she had been raped on several occasions and that the accused first abused her when she was in Class X. He had also allegedly threatened her with dire consequences if she revealed the incident to anyone. Following this, she was abused several more times. The girl, however, couldn't share her agony with anyone as she had been staying alone with her stepfather at home. Her mother works as a maid in the Gulf.

The victim spilled the beans when a relative approached the family with a marriage proposal for the girl. She then informed the relative that she was not ready for marriage as she has been abused several times by her stepfather. It was the relative who took her home and gave her the confidence to lodge a complaint.

Incidentally, what surprised the police was that though the victim has been staying at the relative's house for the last three months, her mother was unaware that her daughter had been abused by her second husband.
