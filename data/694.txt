Description:
			Trupti Borkar, mother of a one-year-old girl, hanged herself from the ceiling hook. She was depressed over her husband's illicit relationship and had many times warned of ending her life. Her husband Roshan was also seen roaming with the girl whom he had met at a construction site. He had stopped paying attention towards Trupti and their daughter Sangoli. He would spend hours talking to some girl on his cell phone.
