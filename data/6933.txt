Description:
			A 22-year-old man was arrested by the Vakola police after he got intimate with a young woman, promising to marry her, and later demanded sexual favours from her sister. Police officials said the accused, Milind Baid, told his friend, Babu Dhotre, about his relationship. Dhotre then threatened the victim to get intimate with him, following which she got pregnant. The sordid story came to light after the victim's younger sister approached the Vakola police. Dhotre is on the run.

The victim, who is in her mid-twenties, worked as a receptionist at a dispensary. She and Baid lived in the same neighbourhood at Santa Cruz East. In 2012, the two got friendly as Baid used to visit the dispensary. Baid, 22,who is unemployed, got intimate with the victim after promising to tie the knot with her. He later confided in his friend, Dhotre, 35, a plumber.

"Dhotre approached the victim and told her that he knew about her relationship with Baid. He threatened to make the fact public and defame her. He got intimate with the victim, against her wishes. When she was three months pregnant, Dhotre forced the victim to get an abortion," said a police official.

Baid meanwhile got acquainted with the victim's younger sister and tried to get intimate with her. Scared that she would be targeted by Baid and Dhotre, like the victim was, her younger sister approached the Vakola police station and lodged a complaint.

Baid and Dhotre have been booked under sections 376, 420, 354 (a), 506 and 34 of the IPC for rape, stalking, cheating and intimidation. The police are hunting for Dhotre while Baid has been taken into custody.
