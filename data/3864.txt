			A 16-year-old girl student allegedly threw her newborn baby from the window of her school hostel in the district following which the infant died.

The girl, studying in class X at a state-run residential school for girls, had delivered a baby boy in the early hours at the school hostel. However, the panic-stricken girl threw the newborn from the window of the hostel toilet, the infant died while undergoing treatment.

During the preliminary investigation, it was found that the girl's marriage was fixed with her aunt's son. When she had gone to her house at Pitlam mandal during the vacations last year, they had physical relations which resulted in her pregnancy.

The girl subsequently returned to the hostel and used to tell her teachers that she was unwell. However, she kept mum about her pregnancy and used to cover her stomach.
