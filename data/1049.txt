Description:
			12 yr old Meenu (name changed) was introduced to the so-called Baba' whom her mother used to visit. Speaking to TOI, said that the Baba used to tell her to send messages to him and also touched her at wrong places. "I was also asked to clean rooms and work in the kitchen. The Baba also sent me to work at his friend's place. My mother knew about my plight but she did not protest," said Meenu.
