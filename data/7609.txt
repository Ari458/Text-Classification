Murder, Dowry Harassment
Description:
			A 22-year-old woman was allegedly burnt alive for dowry at Balarampalli village, 15 km from here, on Sunday morning.

Police identified her as Pramila Sahu. She sustained 80% burns and succumbed at MKCG Medical College and Hospital here.

Pramila's mother Manjula has lodged a police complaint, alleging that her daughter was set ablaze for dowry. "Her in-laws tortured her for dowry. We suspect they poured kerosene and set her on fire," she said.

Pramila married Subash Sahu, 25, a daily wage labourer of Kukudakhandi, in February.

Subash refuted the dowry allegation. "My wife committed suicide. I also sustained burns while trying to save her. There was no one in the house at the time of the incident," he told police during interrogation.

He too is undergoing treatment at the MKCG, said IIC of Berhampur Sadar police station A K Sethi. "The body has been sent for postmortem. We will proceed with the investigation after getting the autopsy report," he added.
