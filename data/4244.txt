Rape
Description:
			A 22-year-old woman has accused her father of raping her over a year following which she became pregnant, police said today.

"The victim is the resident of Sachin GIDC area of the city. She had been repeatedly raped by her father Aslam Khan Pathan for almost a year, which led to the pregnancy," they said quoting the complaint filed by the victim today.

Police said the incident came to light last month after the woman delivered a baby at civil hospital here.

"The accused had hospitalised the victim in the hospital for delivery. As other members of the family came to know about the birth of the baby, they created a furore," police said, adding the victim approached police on insistence of the family members.

Police have sent the woman and her baby for forensic tests and will conduct DNA tests of the accused once he is arrested, to ascertain the victim's claim.
