Abuse
Description:
			Kalpana Meena(24)got married in 2008. Since then her inlaws were harassing her in the name of dowry. Meena's father claims he had done enough to please them at the time of marriage. Before taking the worst step, she had called me in the evening and narrated how her family members including husband and mother-in-law were torturing her to bring a dowry of Rs 5 lakh and a new car. She had given birth to two daughters six months back and her problems with inlaws aggravated thereafter.

Meena hanged herself from the ceiling fan at her inlaws house. 


Again I think a case should be filed against the Meena's Father for letting his daughter stay in such a home which was obviously not safe for her. If parents continue forcing their daughters to stay with such animals, what good can come out of it? Nothing. Meena's  Suicide is a wake up call to those parents who force their daughters to put up to the abuse of their husbands and inlaws. shame on you all.
