Description:
			Mother of a 15-year-old girl registered a complaint with Vadaj police against her neighbour for raping her daughter. The accused also allegedly forced the victim to abort her three-month-old fetus.

Khushi (name changed), 15, was spotted by her mother crying in her room on August 3. When questioned, she said that her neighbour Sanjay Thakor had approached her three months ago in the afternoon. He locked the house and raped her. He threatened her with dire consequences if she complained.

"On August 1, when Sanjay met her outside his home, Khushi told him that she feared that she might be pregnant. He immediately took her for check-up and after the pregnancy was confirmed, he took her to a clinic. When the doctor refused to abort, he took her to another clinic and got the pregnancy terminated. He again threatened her that he would tell everybody about the incident if she did not keep mum," said a Vadaj police official.

Police have charged Thakor with rape and intimidation.
