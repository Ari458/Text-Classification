Child Sexual Abuse, Molestation
Description:
			Two beat marshal cops attached to the Koparkhairane police station foiled an alleged rape attempt on a five-year-old Ghansoli girl by a youth who resides in her neighbourhood. The duo was on night patrol duty in Ghansoli on Saturday night when the incident occurred. 

Senior police inspector Dilip Jagdale said, "The incident occurred on Saturday around 11.30pm in the mangroves area on the Ghansoli stretch of Palm Beach Road. The accused, identified as 20-year-old Rahul Patkar, is a resident of Siddhivinayak Society, sector-9, Ghansoli. He has been booked under sections 363 and 354 of the IPC for kidnapping and outraging the modesty and also under section 7 and 8 of the Pocso Act, 2012. The minor girl's father is an auto driver, while the accused is an HSC student. He offered some food to the minor girl and took her to the bushes allegedly to assault her sexually." The two beat marshals on night patrol in Ghansoli spotted a bike parked near the mangroves. 

Suresh Mengade, DCP (crime), said, "They went inside where they found the accused with the five-year-old minor girl. On questioned about his intention to take the minor girl to the secluded place, the accused gave evasive replies. So, he was taken to the Koparkhairane police station, where he confessed that he intended to sexually assault the minor girl." 

The accused youth's mother insisted that her son not be booked for an offence as he had not harmed the minor girl. 

DCP Mengade added, "But the accused youth could have raped the girl and to destroy evidence even killed her. So, we have arrested him."
