Description:
			Sexual harassment over mobile messaging applications and social media seems to be adding to the troubles of women. The crime branch on Friday arrested a 35-year-old computer engineer for allegedly sending obscene messages and video clips to a woman in Mumbai who happens to be his distant relative.

Sayajigunj-resident Vipul Upadhyay was held for sending the messages to the woman since November 23, 2015.

The incident came to light after the woman told about the incident to her brother Jaykumar Pandya, who approached the city police and filed complaint with the cybercrime cell. The text messages and clippings were sent using WhatsApp and another application Way2sms.

"After receiving the complaint we tracked the mobile number. The number was registered in the name of Kinari Patadiya a resident of Karelibaug. When we approached Patadiya she told us that the mobile number was being used by her 12-year-old son who lost his phone on November 22," said Cyber Crime cell police sub inspector AD Gamit.

Upon further investigation the police came to know that few days after the phone was lost they blocked the number. They later bought another SIM card with the same number on December 9. The police were able to track down the accused using the IMEI number of the lost phone.

"Upadhyay had found the lost phone near Karelibaug water tank. He used the phone to send the messages to the complainant's sister," added Gamit.
