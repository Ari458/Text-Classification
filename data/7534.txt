Description:
			Police on Sunday registered a case against principal of Lutheran Girls' High School at Rentachintala in Guntur district, basing on a complaint lodged by a Ninth Standard student that pressure was being brought on girl-students, including herself, to move closely with boys outside their school.

Rentachintala SI K Anand said the boys were once students of the principal Hilda Lalita Kumari and they keep visiting the school and help the principal in doing sundry works like getting provisions from the market, doing electrical work and other household chores.

The principal kept asking the students to speak to them freely on mobile phones whenever they visited the school. She used to offer her mobile phone to the students to speak to the youths. As this was becoming too much a pressure to bear, the girls reported the problem to their parents who, in turn, made one of the girls lodge a complaint with the police.

We have prima facie evidence against the principal that she was encouraging girls to move closely with the boys though she never asked them to meet them outside the school. All the time, she was asking them to move closely and speak to them whenever they visited the school. The only benefit that the principal would get by asking the girls to do as she told them was that she would not have to pay the youths for doing sundry favours for her, the SI said.
