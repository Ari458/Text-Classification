Description:
			A two-and-a-half-year-old girl was allegedly assaulted with an iron rod by a teacher at her playschool in Maruti Kunj on Wednesday, leaving a deep gash on the child's head.

The teacher, a woman in her mid-30s, also allegedly bit the child's grandmother when she went to the school to lodge a complaint. The child's family approached the police on Thursday and an FIR was filed. But the teacher has gone missing.

The child is a kindergarten student in Gayatri Vidya Mandir and had been attending the school for the last five months, her father Krishan Nainvaya said. He alleged there had been complaints of beatings earlier as well and the teacher used to lock up kids in a bathroom to punish them. The girl had returned with an injured chin last month too, but the family had not filed a complaint after school authorities told them that she had fallen down.

"On Wednesday, the child returned from school around 1pm. The girl's father patted her head while receiving her and she started crying. When he removed the child's cap, he noticed a blood clot and a deep cut at the side of her head," said ACP Hawa Singh.
