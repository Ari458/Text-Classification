Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A 59-year-old driver at a licensed children's home in Vellore has been arrested for sexually abusing a few girls in the home for several months. 

The incident came to light when district child protection officer (DCPO) Nishanthini visited the home for a routine inspection a couple of days ago. 

While interacting with the children, she educated them about sexual abuse and encouraged them to complain if anyone misbehaved with them. 

Mustering courage, a few of the girls in the home told the DCPO that Jebamani, who has been working as a driver in the home, had been sexually abusing them for several months. They also told the officer that he had threatened them not to disclose his act to anyone. 

Following this, Nishanthini lodged a complaint with police against the driver. Inspector of Vellore South police station Nagarajan arrested Jebamani on Saturday and handed him to the all-woman police, Vellore. 

The police registered a case against him under the provision of Section 8 (punishment for sexual assault) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act 2012. He was remanded in judicial custody. 

Sources said that the DCPO would conduct an independent inquiry with the inmates of the home, both boys and girls aged between 4 and 17 years, and file a detailed report to the concerned authorities.
