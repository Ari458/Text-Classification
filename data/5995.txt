Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A women's special court on Wednesday awarded 10 years imprisonment to a tuition teacher for penetrative sexual assault on a Class 11 girl in Guindy. Police had registered the case in November 2012.

S Kannan, 38, a resident of Mettupalayam near Maduvangarai in Guindy, sexually assaulted the girl after asking her to come back after tuition hours. When the girl kept to herself for several days, her family members turned suspicious. After much persuasion, the girl told the family that she had blacked out. When she opened her eyes, she found herself naked.

The girl lodged a police complaint a week later, and was sent to the Government General Hospital for medical examination. Based on the complaint of the girl's father, who works as a legal advisor for a few private firms, Guindy police registered a case under IPC Section 376 (rape) and 354 (outraging the modesty of women). Kannan has been sent to Puzhal prison.

As the Prevention of Child Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act was introduced a week after the police registered the FIR, they altered the case to invoke Pocso. Women's court judge Meena Sathish sentenced Kannan to 10 years imprisonment.

Kannan, a bachelor, lived with his parents. He ran the tuition centre on the ground floor, while his parents stayed on the first floor.
