Murder
Description:
			A 37-year-old man has been arrested for allegedly killing his pregnant wife and six-year-old son today in Sultanpuri area of Outer Delhi.

According to police, the accused, Mukesh Chauhan, made a PCR call around 9:10 AM and said that he had killed his wife and son, and was going to a railway station to commit suicide by jumping before a train.

A police team reached the house of Chauhan, an assistant to an architect, in Sultanpuri and found the bodies of his wife Lata (32) and son Devanshu (6).

Although Chauhan's entire family, which included his three brothers and their families, lived in the same four-storey building, they were not aware of the incident until police reached the house around 9:15 AM.

Soon several teams were dispatched to track Chauhan so that he can be nabbed before he harms himself. He was arrested from the Nangloi railway station within an hour of the call after his cell phone location was tracked by the police.

During questioning, Mukesh revealed that he had frequent arguments with his wife over his poor financial condition. He was also under stress due to Devanshu's mental illness.

"The couple had fought over the issue for the entire night. At around 6 AM, Chauhan strangled to death both of them. He started from home around two hours later on a bike and made a PCR call where he informed police about the incident," said a senior police officer.

He reached the railway station but could not muster the courage to jump in front of a train and was finally arrested by the police. He has been booked other Section 302 and other relevant sections of the IPC and further investigations are on, the officer said.

Lata's family told police that she was seven to eight months' pregnant. Both the bodies have been sent for post-mortem.
