Description:
			Police on Saturday arrested a 43-year-old MTC conductor for misbehaving with a woman passenger on a bus at Kelambakkam, 45km from here. The conductor, M Mahesh, was produced before a magistrate court in Chengalpet where he secured bail. 

The 23-year-old software engineer, Deepika Balasubramanian, lodged a complaint after Mahesh allegedly attacked her while she was travelling from Kelambakkam to Karapakkam on Wednesday. 

Based on her complaint, police arrested Mahesh. But Deepika said she had a tough time to report her case. "I had to run from pillar to post. After I complained to the city police control room, police followed the MTC bus (route number 568) plying between Mamallapuram and Adyar. The Kannagi Nagar police advised me to meet personnel at Thoraipakkam police station. They then sent me to Thalambur police station where I was asked to lodge a complaint at Kelambakkam police station," the techie said. 

Deepika said this was not the first time Mahesh had misbehaved with her. "The same conductor had quarreled with me on June 30. I had tried to take a video when he started hurling abuses." 

According to Deepika, the conductor refused to stop the bus at a scheduled halt and when she confronted him, she was told that it was not possible to halt the bus at every stop during rush hours. When the woman started to record the conversation asking if that was the official stand of MTC, Mahesh allegedly slapped her and threatened her if she complained.
