Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			A Delhi Traffic Police constable has been arrested for allegedly stalking and harassing a DU student in east Delhi’s Gandhi Nagar area.

The accused constable has been identified as 21-year-old Anil Kumar. Police said he was in his uniform when he allegedly approached the girl on Tuesday evening and asked for her mobile phone number.

The girl refused to entertain him and instead informed her parents upon reaching home. Her family confronted the constable and raised an alarm which drew the attention of the local people. While some persons began manhandling him, someone informed the police.

A PCR van soon arrived at the spot and took him away. A case of molestation was registered against the accused based on the girl’s complaint and the accused was arrested, said a senior police officer.

The student has alleged that Kumar has been following her for the past five days while she would return home from tuitions.

She had warned him to keep away and had informed her parents about the matter at the very start, she told police.
