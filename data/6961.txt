When the elderly women resisted and raised an alarm, the 37-year old accused, Latif Mondal, bit her earlobes while trying to pull one of her earrings. He even punched her in her face and eyes. 

The survivor was alone at home when the incident took place on Sunday evening. The accused was later nabbed by locals and handed over to cops. The survivor's kin had gone out and taking the opportunity, the accused, who is also a neighbour of the woman, sneaked into her house.
