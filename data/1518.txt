Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			A student of Jadavpur Universitys Salt Lake campus has accused a physics teacher of molesting her when she met him in a laboratory to catch up on some lessons she had missed.

Jadavpur University registrar Pradip Ghosh confirmed receiving the girl's complaint through the head of the instrumentation engineering department, Bipan Tudu. I have since forwarded it to our sexual harassment cell. The panel has been asked to probe the alleged incident and submit a report at the earliest,Ghosh said. 

According to the the complaint, the physics teacher was alone in the laboratory when she walked in to clear some doubts about certain chapters. She had apparently not been attending classes for some days prior to that incident. The accused is a leader of the CPM-controlled Jadavpur University Teachers' Association. He was unavailable for comment.
