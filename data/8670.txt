Molestation
Description:
			A special investigation team (SIT) was constituted by Patna police on Monday to investigate the alleged molestation of a girl border of the NIT-Patna's hostel on Saturday night

Police sources said three persons of the construction company, which is working on the institute campus, have been detained for questioning by police so far. One of the company's workers had allegedly tried to molest the student. An FIR in the case was lodged on Sunday with Pirbahore police station by the assistant director of NIT.

Patna SSP Manu Maharaaj said, "We had a meeting with the college authorities and would deploy more policemen on the institute campus. Since the institute is located under Pirbahore police station area, the number of cops at the police station would also be increased to cater to the needs of the institute."

The team investigating the case has started collecting address and photographs of the workers of the construction company engaged in work at the institution.

Sources said two girls have agreed to identify the accused as they had seen him closely. "It is definitely a case of negligence by the college authorities from security point of view to allow male workers to stay at the same building where the girls are residing. We have asked the institute authorities to deploy women officials and workers for the girls' hostels, as many complained that all the housekeeping staff and cleanliness workers were male," the SSP added.
