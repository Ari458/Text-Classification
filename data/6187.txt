Child Sexual Abuse, Murder, Rape
Description:
			A minor, allegedly raped, was found murdered at a village in Malda Kaliachak area. The accused was arrested and presented at the Malda court on Sunday, which sent him to three-day police custody.
The incident took place on Saturday when the nine-year-old victim was out with her five-year-old brother at a mango orchard to tend goats and collect sticks for fuel.
The accused, a local, allegedly saw the two. He gave some sticks to the boy and asked him to return home. While the boy returned, the girl couldn't be found. Unable to find her, the girl's parents filed a missing complaint in the evening at the police station.
Late Saturday, villagers spotted her body at the garden. Police sources said the girl's semi nude body was recovered with a slit throat. She also had injury marks on her ear. Later, the accused was arrested. Prima facie it appears to be a case of rape and murder but the exact reason will be known after the postmortem report arrives, said police.
Meanwhile, locals, alleging police inaction, held a protest. The victim's father is a daily labourer.
