Child Sexual Abuse, Murder, Rape
Description:
			In a shocking incident at Ushaiti village under Badaun Kotwali on Tuesday night, two minor girls aged 14 and 15 years were raped and killed. Their bodies were then hanged from a tree. Among those suspected of involvement in the crime are five people, among them two policemen. 

The girls were sexually assaulted when they had gone to fields to answer nature's call. They failed to return after long hours, and parents and villagers set out in search of them. 

The bodies of the two were found hanging from a mango tree, with injury marks all over their bodies. Their clothes were torn, pointing to physical assault.

Villagers informed police, who took custody of the bodies and sent them for post-mortem examination. 

The parents of the girls registered an FIR in which they accused five people, including three brothers. Among the accused are a man named Pappu and two constables, Sarvesh Kumar Yadav and Ram Niwas. 

Badaun SP Man Singh Chauhan said a case had been registered under sections of the IPC dealing with rape and murder. Two of the constables suspected of involvement have been arrested, and one of the three brothers has been nabbed, the police official said. 

Angry villagers have complained that the police have been attempting to be soft on the criminals, in a bid to spare their colleagues.
