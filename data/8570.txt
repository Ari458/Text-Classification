Murder
Description:
			A young man murdered his 55-year-old mother and then burnt her body in Sindri on Thursday for allegedly practising black magic.

Sindri police arrested Lakhindra Hembrom (24) and forwarded him to judicial custody on Thursday.

Sub-inspector Ramesh Prasad said Lakhindra had an altercation with her mother, Sadhuri Manjhian, around 10 pm on Wednesday. He attacked his mother with an iron rod. When she cried for help, his younger sister Lakshmi and cousin Srinath tried to rescue her but Lakhindra hit them too with the rod and scared them away.

When her mother died, he took the body to the courtyard and burnt it before fleeing. His father Vhado Hembrom is a contract worker and was not present in the house at the time of incident.

Sadhuri's family members informed the neighbours and police. Lakhindra was caught at Chasnala.

At the police station when mediapersons asked him why he killed his mother, Lakhindra said she was a witch and used to practice black magic. "I was frustrated with the kich-kich (altercation) and killed her," he said.
