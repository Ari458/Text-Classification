Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A youth has been arrested on the charge of raping a minor who was found bleeding and semi-conscious at the Indian Botanic Garden in Shibpur on Sunday evening.

Police on Tuesday registered a case under IPC section 376, which deals with rape, after a doctor of Howrah District Hospital submitted a report saying a preliminary examination of the girl suggested sexual assault.

The 15-year-old's parents have refused to allow the police to send her for a medical test to confirm the assault. Nor have they mentioned rape in the complaint lodged with Botanic Garden police station, which states that someone drugged their daughter and that her cell phone was missing.

"Our findings corroborate the doctor's preliminary report. Since police cannot register a rape case on their own, we treated the doctor's finding as a complaint and booked the accused," said an officer of Howrah police commissionerate.

The girl in a statement to the police on Sunday had given the phone number of the accused. She said he was from her village in Birbhum and they knew each other for some time.

On Sunday, however, she had said she first met him at Howrah station the same day.

"The girl's parents have again been requested to give us their consent for a medical test," said Ranendranath Banerjee, deputy commissioner (headquarters), Howrah.
