Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A goods vehicle driver, who has been on the run after his Class 10 lover delivered a baby in a private hospital at Vadavalli here on Monday, was arrested on Tuesday for impregnating the minor girl. Police have booked N Manikandan, 27, of VNR Nagar at Vadavalli, under Prevention of Children from Sexual offences Act (POCSO).

According to police, Manikandan lured the girl saying that he was in love with her. "He has been sexually abusing the girl for the past one-and-a-half years,'' police said. During the interrogation, Manikandan claimed that his intention was to marry the girl. "But according to law, sexual relationship with a minor girl is illegal and considered a rape,'' police said.

The girl had concealed her pregnancy from her parents, who also failed to notice the physical changes in her as she was obese. It was when she developed stomach pain on Sunday night and taken to the hospital, doctors informed the parents about the pregnancy.

The family, which initially wanted to disown the girl, later agreed to lodge a complaint against Manikandan.

The accused was produced before court, which sent him to Coimbatore central prison.
