Description:
			Ten months after installing Active Tracker devices at sonography centres across Kolhapur, the state research team, appointed to look into the efficacy of the device, said there has been no significant change in sex-ratio at birth in the area. 

We have compiled data since March 2011, when Active Trackers were installed in around 270 sonography centres in Kolhapur city as well as places under Kolhapur district. 

Our report, submitted to the State Government last month, shows no difference in the sex-ratio at birth compared to the last two years, Dr Prakash Doke, who headed the state-appointed research team, said.
