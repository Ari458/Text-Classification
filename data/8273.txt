Description:
			A 28-year-old man was arrested on Thursday for allegedly raping a woman and aborting her child. Victim had filed a police complaint last month that the accused abducted her and held her hostage for more than three months.

A 25-year-old woman, who lives in Maruti Vihar had filed a complaint on December 20 at Bhondsi police station. She stated that she met accused Ravi (28), who hails from Sohna three years ago while studying for JBT. They soon fell in love and Ravi promised to marry her.

Around four months ago, Ravi got a job in a private company and convinced the victim to move in with him and against her family's wishes the victim started living with Ravi in Bhondsi area.

She stated that Ravi raped her multiple times during this time and as a result, she conceived a child a couple of months later. In November, Ravi fed her some pills by mixing them in food which caused a miscarriage and she lost the child.

When the victim confronted Ravi and he revealed that he is married and has a child too back home and therefore cannot marry the woman.
