Molestation
Description:
			A 22-year-old man has been arrested for allegedly molesting a 26-year-old woman. His mother was also held for assaulting a cop at the Sector 10A police station while he was being interrogated. 

The two were produced in a city court on Wednesday, which sent the man to one-day police custody and his mother to judicial custody for 14 days. 

Police said a resident of Basai Enclave filed a complaint on Tuesday afternoon that her neighbour Aman Verma, employed with a private company in the area, had molested her when both of them were talking in front of her house. The complainant is married. 

Following the complaint, an FIR was filed against Aman under Section 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) of the IPC and he was summoned to the police station the same day. 

The accused reached there with his parents, Gopal and Sunita Verma. While the accused was being questioned by the cops, his mother allegedly started hurling abuses at the complainant, and even assaulted a police officer in a fit of rage. "The woman lost her temper and thrashed ASI Sanjeev Kumar when he asked her to calm down. She also tore his uniform," said a police officer.
