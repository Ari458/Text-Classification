Abuse
Description:
			A 30-year-old woman who was being brutalized by her husband in Gandhinagar, for allegedly refusing to get into the flesh trade, has been rescued. The woman was saved by the 181 Abhayam helpline and was admitted to Gandhinagar Civil Hospital. Pethapur police have taken her complaint against her husband for domestic violence and assault and have started search for him.

181 officials received a call on Monday from a resident in Sector 7 about a woman in dire need of help. The caller said that the woman had been brutally beaten up by her husband and she could not even move. An 181 team found marks of heavy beatings on hand, shoulders, and back.

"We took her to the hospital where we were shocked to learn that she had injuries on her private parts," said an 181 counselor. "Her husband used to brand her with bidis on her legs and used to bite her. When we questioned her about the reason for such brutality, she said that her husband wanted more money from her for liquor and thus was trying to force her into prostitution."

Geeta Thakor (name changed) had married 11 years ago and the couple has three children. After a few years of good married life, her husband started drinking after losing his job, forcing her to take up odd jobs to sustain the family. For the past few months, the assaults became more and more vicious. He had barred her from meeting anyone.

"She had sneaked out of home on the pretext of taking the children to her parents' home - the spot from where she was found," said the counsellor. "
