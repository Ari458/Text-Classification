Domestic Violence, Murder, Dowry Harassment
Description:
			In a ghastly incident, a 2-year-old girl and her mother were brutally done to death by her father and his family members, as the hapless woman failed to pay the dowry. The mother and child were killed and their bodies set ablaze to wipe off any proof. The mortal remains were thrown to river Manjira later.

The shocking incident of dowry murder that occured on May 15, came to light three months after the incident as the parents of the woman filed a missing complaint with the police.

The murder of Ishwarya (2) and her mother Swapna (25) took place on May 15, but the accused did not leave an iota of doubt and not even the womans parents were aware of it.

According to Sangareddy DSP Tirupathianna, Begari Ravinder of Chetla Naganpally village in Raikode mandal married Swapna of Narsampet in Warangal in 2011. Initially, the couple was happy, but later Ravinder started to harass Swapna for dowry. In 2013, she lodged a complaint regarding domestic violence and a case was also registered.

After the case against him was dismissed, Ravinder maintained good relations with Swapna for a week and disappeared thereafter.

On May 15, Ravinders family took Swapna to Krishnas house at Neradigunta. At night, Ravinder and Krishna killed Swapna, and later burnt the body. The remains were disposed of in Manjira River near Chitkul. And after three days, they killed Ishwarya also and burnt the body. Meanwhile, Swapnas parents searched for her. The parents felt suspicious and contacted the police, who investigated and arrested Ravinder.
