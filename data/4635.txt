Child Sexual Abuse, Molestation
Description:
			A middle-aged man was arrested in Ranchi on Sunday after his teenaged daughter brought charges of rape attempt against him.

The 15-year-old girl, who is a domestic help at the same apartment in Lower Bazaar where her father works, said in her FIR the 45-year-old man tried to rape her on Sunday morning when she was alone. The owners were out in the morning and he took advantage of the situation, the girl said in her report lodged with Lower Bazaar police.

When she raised an alarm, the security guard of the building and other residents came to her rescue and caught the father and handed him to the police. "We lodged an FIR after the girl levelled the charges. The matter is under investigation," said city DSP P N Singh.

The girl lives in Argora, which is 3-4km from Lower Bazaar, with her parents and other relatives who were shocked to know about the incident. The man was not drunk, police said.

Police said the man was working as a help at the apartment while his daughter was a maid there. On Sunday morning, the girl reached for work after the owners had left. Her father, however, was present in the apartment. No sooner did the girl start working than her father attacked her and tried to rape her, charges that the man had denied, said police.

Lower Bazaar OC Vinay Kumar Singh said, quoting locals, "The accused often drank and did not socialize much," he said, adding, "we can comment (on the case) only after the investigation is complete."
