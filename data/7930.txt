Molestation, Street Harassment
Description:
			Even as the shock over the gang rape of a woman in a moving vehicle last week is yet to subside, a disabled elderly woman has reported being molested in the heart of the city, near the Shivajinagar bus stand, on Tuesday evening. 

The incident took place around 6pm when the woman was walking into a shop near Amanath Bank, just next to the bus stand. 

The 64-year-old recounted her ordeal to Deccan Herald, As I walked into the shop, I suddenly felt something landing on my back really hard. When I looked back, this man stood smiling after hitting me on my back. He was accompanied by a friend of his. 

What everyone witnessing the incident around me, including the shopkeeper, did was give a goofy smile. It looked like this was a dare game between the men. Enraged by the assault, the woman, who walks with a crutch, gave the man a whack with her crutch. Even as he looked at her menacingly, no one around approached to  help her, she said.

When she dialled the police emergency number, 100, there was no response. More shockingly, when she approached policemen patrolling nearby in a Hoysala vehicle, no help came from their end either. 

Two of the policemen simply went around in circles looking for the man. Of course, by then he had disappeared, she said. The woman was accompanied by her 60-year-old schizophrenic brother. Both of them were forced to walk back home with no help coming their way. 

Disappointed with the police response, the woman said she was given to feel that Bengaluru had become unsafe for women. This happened in a busy area like Shivajinagar. If this could happen to me, it could happen to anyone. The police need to buck up if they have to stop such acts against women.
