Street Harassment
Description:
			A Group of Volunteers set out to conduct a survey about sexual harassment in public places in Mumbai. 1,000 interviews later, they realised how big the problem really is and how little is being done to resolve it.

Some Findings of the Survey

1. Eight out of every 10 women in the city are subjected to some form of harassment in public places every day. 

2. The maximum cases of verbal and physical harassment take place in crowded areas such as trains and railway platforms

3. 60% of the women admitted to being harassed while commuting by train and 40% when travelling by other public transport systems such as buses, taxis and autos.

4. 20% were subjected to unwelcome advances from the opposite sex at beaches, entertainment parks, educational institutions and even residential complexes.

5. Only one out of 10 women lodges a police complaint, and not more than two confront the perpetrator or attempt to stop him.

6. Only two out of every 10 women glare angrily at the offender. The rest just ignore him or worse, feel embarrassed or ashamed of themselves.

7. Most women do not consider catcalls or lewd comments as sexual harassment, but an unfortunate drawback of being a woman.
