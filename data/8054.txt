Dowry Harassment
Description:
			More than two-and-a-half years after a 21-year-old woman was brutally killed in a daylight acid attack at an Internet browsing centre at Adambakkam here, a trial court on Wednesday sentenced the assailant to life term.

The Principal Sessions Court in Chengalpattu largely relied on the dying declaration of victim Vidhya and eyewitness accounts in one of the most shocking acid attacks the State witnessed in 2013  hardly a couple of months after a similar acid attack on J Vinothini in Karaikal.

The two killings forced the State and Central governments to  bring in stringent regulations on the sale of acid.

Vidhya was working in a browsing centre on Tiruvallur Road in Adambakkam on January 29, 2013, when convict S Vijaya Baskar, aged 30 then, walked into the centre and threw acid on her, for refusing to come out with him. Vidhya survived with severe burns and was battling for life for nearly a month before succumbing at the Kilpauk Medical College Hospital.

They were in a relationship and their families had also agreed to get them married, though they belonged to different castes. But their parents had wanted them not to go out together. So Vidhya had been refusing to go out with Vijaya Baskar for a few weeks. Angered by this, he had brought a bottle of acid with him and threw it on her on the fateful day, said public prosecutor K Arumugam.

Vijaya Baskar was caught by neighbours and handed over to the Adambakkam police, who later investigated the case.

The case was transferred to the Chengalpattu Principal District Sessions Court and after nearly two-and-a-half years of trial, on Wednesday, judge R Selvakumar held that the prosecution had proved the charges beyond doubt. Vijaya Basakar was convicted on charges of murder.

Vidhya had categorically stated that she was attacked by Vijaya Baskar in her dying declaration in the hospital, which was the clinching evidence against the assailant.
