Description:
			A city-based lawyer, Yogesh Bhardwaj (37), was arrested on Thursday for reportedly uploading obscene photos of a Vashi woman, who had earlier charged him with rape.

"The accused was arrested under Section 66A of the Information Technology Act, for allegedly uploading vulgar photos of the victim. He was granted bail the same day," said a senior inspector of Vashi police station, Ram Pathare.

He added that the victim had earlier accused Bhardwaj of rape, cheating and trying to extort money. However, he managed to secure anticipatory bail each time.

Bhardwaj, the victim said, was her lawyer and was helping her fight another rape case against her MBA tutor in 2011.

They soon got into a relationship, which eventually turned sour.

The woman alleged that it was then that Bhardwaj uploaded objectionable photos on a website and also tried to extort money.

Bhardwaj, however, counter alleged that the victim was trying to extort money from him by filing several complaints.

"I will soon prove my client Bhardwaj's innocence in court," said Bhardwaj's counsel, Naveen Chomal.
