Description:
			In a shocking incident, a 30-year-old woman and her three children allegedly committed suicide in Ishrol village under Chauhatan police station of Barmer district following a suspected case of dowry harassment.

Reshmi Devi, wife of Banka Ram, and her three sons - Raju (7), Varda (5) and Trilok (4) - jumped into a water tank and drowned when her husband had gone to Barmer for work.

The bodies of the four were fished out by the police on Tuesday and kept in the mortuary. Family members of Reshmi at Jalore were informed about the incident, and the post mortem carried out on Wednesday.

According to Barmer SP Gagandeep Singla, Reshmi Devi had left home on Tuesday along with her sons. When she didn't return in the evening, her husband went in search of the family and found the slippers of children lying outside a water tank around 1-2km away from their home. He then found their bodies floating in the tank.

Reshmi allegedly threw her children into the tank and later jumped in and committed suicide, said Chauhatan station officer in-charge Om Prakash Vishnoi.

Following the incident, Reshmi's relatives alleged that she was regularly beaten and harassed by in-laws for dowry. They also claimed that the in-laws had murdered her and the children and thrown them into the tank. A case has been filed against father-in-law Gena Ram, his elder brother Gordhan Ram and the mother-in-law for harassing Reshmi for dowry. The police are investigating the case.
