Rape
Description:
			Satish Kumar, owner of Umang Hostel in the Fairfield Colony at Digha, was arrested on Saturday for allegedly attempting to rape a 13-year-old physically-challenged inmate. 

SP (City) Kim said the victim - a deaf and dumb girl and a Class VI student, gave her statement to police through gestures. The incident took place on Thursday night and the girl, a student of Ashadeep School, informed her teacher about it the next day. The hostel owner also allegedly assaulted her for disclosing the incident. 

The FIR alleged Satish entered the girl's room around 8pm and fled only after the girl somehow managed to draw the attention of other hostel inmates.
