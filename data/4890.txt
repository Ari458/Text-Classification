Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			Ishwar Yadav alias Bari, 23, a labourer working at a factory at Marcaim industrial estate was arrested by Ponda police on Sunday evening for allegedly raping his colleague's four-year-old daughter earlier in the day.

Yadav and the survivor were referred to Goa medical college and hospital at Bambolim for a medical examination.

Ponda police said that Yadav and the girl's parents are colleagues, working in the same factory and all stay in rooms provided by the factory in the estate.

At the time of the alleged rape, the girl's parents were on duty. When they returned to their room for lunch they found their daughter missing and immediately informed factory officials. A search was launched and the girl was found in the neighbourhood.

"As she was found to be rather dull, they took her to a local medical practitioner who referred her to Ponda sub-district hospital where doctors found that the child had been sexually abused and informed Ponda police," police said.

Yadav was then arrested in the village and has been booked under Sections 363, 376 of Indian Penal Code and Section 8 of the Goa Children's Act.
