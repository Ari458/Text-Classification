Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			Two days after she was raped allegedly by the son of a gram panchayat member, a 16-year-old girl committed suicide by hanging in her house in the district on Wednesday.

Police said Pavan, 22, has been arrested on charges of rape, abetment to suicide and many sections under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012. His mother is a member of the Vaddanakuppe Gram Panchayat in Periyapatna, a taluk bordering Kodagu and about 85km west of Mysore.

This is the second rape incident reported from Mysore in three weeks. A 23-year-old woman was sexually assaulted in Nanjangud in mid-July.

Additional superintendent of police M Pradeep Kumar told TOI that the SSLC student set out to fetch milk from a village shop on Monday evening and didn't return. When she didn't come home in the night, her worried mother lodged a missing complaint with police.

According to police, the girl returned home in the early hours of Tuesday, but slept outside the house as her family of mother, two sisters and a brother was fast asleep. Throughout Tuesday, the girl remained aloof, sliding into bouts of depression. When her mother insisted on Wednesday that they go to hospital for a medical examination, the girl told her about the sexual assault on Monday night.

A little later, after her mother left home to seek the advice of village elders before filing a police complaint against the panchayat member's son, the girl took the extreme step of hanging herself.

Police officer Pradeep confirmed that the minor girl had been raped by her acquaintance.
