Description:
			A youth allegedly raped a nine-year-old girl living in his neighbourhood and later shut her inside a cupboard in his room before fleeing.

The accused Bablu (26), a service centre mechanic, took the girl to his room in Qutbullapur on the pretext of offering her chocolate and allegedly committed the crime.

He then shut her inside a cupboard and locked the door of his room and fled, based on a complaint lodged by the girl's grandmother.
