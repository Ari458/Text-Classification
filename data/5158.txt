Dowry Harassment
Description:
			A Panvel-based woman, Amruta Shah (28), has accused her US-based husband, Nilay Shah (28) and in-laws, of dowry harassment and criminal breach of trust. The Panvel police have filed an FIR against the accused. 

In the FIR, she also mentioned that her husband and in-laws took away her gold jewellery, weighing nearly 75 tolas, along with several new sets of clothes to the US. 

"We married in February 2013 at Vadodara, Gujarat. We lived together for around 15 days but then Nilay and his parents went back to the US. They promised to send for me once the visa process was completed," said Amruta. 

The husband, Nilay, reportedly got in touch with Amruta, who is an engineer by profession, in December 2012. 

She kept asking Nilay and her in-laws about her visa, but was told that it was still in process. "I started suspecting their motives when Nilay came to India in January for his sister's wedding. When I asked him about my visa, he said he will require another 100 tolas of gold and around Rs 50 lakh cash to complete the formalities." 

When Amruta checked with the US embassy, she was told that her visa process had been 'stopped' and she will have to reapply. Finally, an FIR was filed on June 28. "Since they are staying in the US, we have to go through diplomatic channels to bring them to India, which can take some time," said a Panvel police official.
