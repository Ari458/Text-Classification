Molestation
Description:
			A 42-year-old married woman was allegedly molested by her 40-year-old neighbor in Kaima-Pahadatali village in the district, police said today.

The victim was allegedly beaten up by the accused. A case under section 345 (outraging the modesty) of IPC was registered against the accused identified as Binod Malik following a complaint lodged by the victim at the local police station on Wednesday.

The incident occurred on January 26 when the victim had been to the accused's house to watch television.

The victim, a mother of one child, used to come to the house of Malik to watch television as both are neighbours. The victim had come to watch tv on Republic day at about 10.30 am. As Malik's family members were away from home, the accused molested the woman finding her alone, said Amitahb Mohapatra, inspector-in-charge (IIC) of Dharmasala police station.

The victim has sustained injury marks on her cheeks and some other parts of the body, the police said adding the accused freed the victim when the latter raised an alarm. She was admitted to the local hospital for treatment.

The accused is a married man and a father of two children, the IIC said.

The victim informed the matter to her husband, a daily wage earner, after he returned home from work in the evening. When the victim?s husband brought the matter to the notice of the village committee on the same night, some villagers tried to suppress the incident and attempted to reach a compromise with the victim?s family.

The victim's family was being presurrised not to lodge an FIR, said the IIC adding the victim, however, filed the complaint on Wednesday.

Police said that the accused was on the run and he would be arrested soon.
