Domestic Violence, Murder
Description:
			What was initially thought to be a dowry harassment case turned out to be a well-planned murder over an illicit relationship.

Hours after a young woman burnt to death in the Park Street area barely a month into her marriage, police arrested her husband and her own sister for executing the crime.

Sources insisted the victim's younger sister - married to the victim's brother-in-law a couple of years ago - had an illicit relationship and was furious when her sister asked her to end the relationship.

According to police, it was on Tuesday around 12:30 am that they received information from CNMC & Hospital that one lady has been admitted having 100% burn injury. The victim was identified as Guria Khatoon (26 yrs) of Bed Ford Lane off Park Street. She was not in a state to give her statement. On Wednesday, she succumbed to her injury around 3.45 pm.

Later the father of the victim, identified as Md Zainul Khan (52 yrs) alleged that his son-in-law Gulzar Khan (27) and his younger married daughter Soni Khatoon (25), both of whom are his neighbours, subjected his youngest daughter Guria to mental and physical torture since her marriage (solemnized on October 27) for demanding more dowry and to suppress their illicit relationship.

The younger sister also demanded that all of victim's jewellery be handed over to her. On November 28, both the accused persons in connivance with each other set her on fire by matchstick after sprinkling kerosene oil on her person with an intention to kill her at residence, said police sources.

On the basis of recorded and signed statement a case under IPC section 302 (murder) 498A (dowry), 406 (criminal breach of trust) and 34 (common intention) and 3 & 4 D.P.Act was lodged. Both FIR named accused persons were arrested. Husband of the victim has also received some burn injury on his person, added police sources.
