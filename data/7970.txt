Rape
Description:
			A woman has accused a man of raping her repeatedly for over a year on the pretext of marrying her and getting her a job with the Delhi government. Police said the man claimed to be the block president of a political party.

In her complaint, the 28-year-old woman said that she had befriended the man, Deepak Chaudhary, during the event of a political party in the area. He then invited her to his house and offered her a drink laced with a sedative and then raped her, she claimed.

The woman, a resident of Patel Nagar, said the man had since then repeatedly raped her on the pretext of marrying her. She filed an FIR with the local police station and a case under Section 376 IPC (rape) was registered against Chaudhary on September 10.

But during interrogation, Chaudhary claimed he had married the woman and had never sexually assaulted her. He even provided proof of their marriage. Police said they are verifying the charges and further investigations are underway.
