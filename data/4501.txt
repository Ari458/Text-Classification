Rape
Description:
			A former BJP MLA from Hamirpur district was booked for allegedly raping a woman in the district two years ago. 

The case of sexual assault was registered after police recorded the statement of the woman and verified the facts.

However, the MLA dubbed the charges as false and politically motivated to harm his reputation. 

In her complaint made on March 5, the victim alleged that the accused, who was then a sitting MLA, sexually assaulted her on March 25, 2012 in his residence in Vidhan Sabha Complex at Shimla. 

The woman claimed that she had approached the MLA for a note for transfer of her husband in March 2012 and he called her to his residence and sexually assaulted her. 

The woman claimed that she had reported the matter to the then DGP and CM office "but no action was taken".
