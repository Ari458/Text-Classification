Abduction, Rape
Description:
			A 20-year-old tribal girl hailing from adjoining Amravati district has alleged she was allegedly gang-raped by three youths, but a senior police officer gave a different version of the episode. 

The victim, who migrated to Yavatmal in search of job about three months ago, has told the police in her complaint she was sexually assaulted by three men on Sunday evening when she was returning home in Jamankar Nagar area from work. 

The trio, who has been arrested, intercepted the girl and forcibly took her on a bike to a nearby village Bhari where they sexually assaulted her, police said, quoting the complaint. 

They repeated the offence a few hours later near another village, she alleged. 

Yesterday she lodged a complaint with Wadgaon Road Police after which the accused, Vivek Bhagvan Wagde, Akash Subhash Narayane (both 19) and Firoj Dnyaneshwar Motghare (22) were arrested and booked for rape and kidnapping, Police Station Officer (PSO) Dilip Raut. 

They were today produced before a local court, which remanded them in police custody till April 24. 

However, when contacted Superintendent of Police Ranjankumar Sharma gave a different version of the episode. 

He said the girl was acquainted with the trio and she lodged the complaint apparently after differences cropped up among them on some issue. The SP also said medical examination has revealed the girl was two months pregnant. 

Sharma said he has asked the PSO to summon her parents and get to the bottom of the entire episode.
