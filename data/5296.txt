Description:
			In what can raise the alarm for many, the accused in two separate incidents used the social-networking site 'Facebook' to sexually assault the victims, as per reports on Wednesday. 

Himanshu Nayak, who works as an engineer in Siltara Industrial Area in Raipur, had sent a friend request to a girl on Facebook who stays in his vicinity. Gradually, they came close to each other. However, on false pretext of getting married, he later raped the girl repeatedly.
