Dowry Harassment
Description:
			Unable to bear continued torture by her husband, a woman along with her two babies, committed suicide by jumping before a passenger train near Nokha railway station, about 20km from Rohtas district headquarter of Sasaram on Monday morning.

All the three died on the spot. One of the babies is four-month-old and the other is four-year-old.

On a written complaint of the father of the woman, Munni Devi, her husband was arrested and sent to jail for torturing his daughter for dowry, according to police sources. Munni Devi of Rohtas village under the same police station of the district was married to an unemployed Rakesh Chaudhary of Bhaluahi under Nokha police station in 2009. But, Rakesh was alcoholic and he always assaulted her for dowry. He did not even spare his old father and his elder brother when the duo protested his act.
