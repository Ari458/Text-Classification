Rape
Description:
			Chitrakoot police lodged a case of rape on Monday morning against the personal assistant of minister for rural development Daddu Prasad. The FIR was filed after a local girl reached the the district police chief's official residence and consumed poison, accusing the local police of not accepting her complaint. What had apparently prompted the police not to register a case initially were the allegations of the victim that the minister's wife too had intervened earlier and offered her a government job if she agreed to keep silent on the issue.

The victim - 27-year-old Kalpana (name changed) alleged that the minister's PA - identified as Angad - had sexually exploited her for seven years on the promise of marrying her, only to dump her later. After she consumed poison on Sunday evening, she was rushed to hospital by the SP resident staff. She was later referred to Allahabad district hospital. What has however added an element of suspicion to the whole incident was the mysterious disappearance of Kalpana from the Mahila hospital in Allahabad on Monday morning. There were reports that Kalpana was seen walking out of the hospital with her elder sister and the minister's PA Angad himself.
