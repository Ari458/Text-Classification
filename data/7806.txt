Molestation, Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			A 22-year-old pregnant woman was allegedly molested by a doctor at southeast Delhi Sangam Vihar area, the police said on Thursday.
The accused, identified as Faqiruddin (45), has been arrested by the police and booked for molestation, said a senior police officer.

Faqiruddin claims to be a medical practitioner with expertise in paediatrics and has a clinic at Sangam Vihar I-block. His wife, who also claims to be a gynaecologist, shares the same premises, said a police officer.

According to the police, the incident was reported on Wednesday afternoon when the pregnant woman who visits Faqiruddin's wife for routine treatment during pregnancy had taken her one-year-old son to Faqiruddin for a check-up.

After attending to the boy, Faqiruddin allegedly asked the woman to get a check up too. However, Faqiruddin's wife the gynaecologist was not present at the clinic yesterday, so Faqiruddin himself offered to attend to the woman, claiming that he had knowledge of gynaecology too.

When the woman agreed, Faqiruddin got the toddler seated outside his chamber and allegedly started to molest the woman. 

Meanwhile, another patient entered the waiting room and, sensing her presence, the victim started to scream, said a police officer.

Faqiruddin came out of his chamber, bolted the door from outside and fled from the clinic. The patient waiting outside, opened the chamber door and later reported the matter to the police.

A police team rushed to the spot and a case was registered at Ambedkar Nagar police station. Fakiruddin was later arrested from his residence, the officer added.
