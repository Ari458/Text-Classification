Description:
			A ten-year-old girl has been allegedly gangraped in neighbouring West Bengal's Purulia district.

The girl was gangraped when she went to attend a marriage function along with her family members on May 30.

The family members, who confirmed the incident, brought the girl to the Tata Main Hospital here for treatment last night but the authorities initially refused to admit her as it was a police case.
