Abuse
Description:
			In a shocking incident, a 40-year-old widow was stripped naked and beaten by her in-laws over a long-standing property dispute. The incident took place at Narsinghpura village of Badi Sadri tehsil in Chittorgarh district.

The victim Kamla Bai was returning home from the animal shed in the farm area at 5.30am after milking buffaloes. She was stopped on the way by her father-in-law Prabhulal Suthar (82), brother-in-law Suresh Suthar (22) and sister-in-law Pushpa. The trio first abused her verbally and later stripped her naked, dragging her to the village temple. The woman was beaten so brutally that she fell unconscious, after which the assailants fled away.

Since the incident took place early in the morning, no one could come to the victim's rescue. However, in the morning some people spotted her in bleeding condition and rushed her to the nearest hospital at Kanod where she is undergoing treatment.

Property dispute has been stated as the main reason for the assault. The victim was said to be living with her daughter-in-law as her son was employed in Mumbai while her in-laws lived somewhere else. The victim's husband died 20 years ago and since then there had been animosity between the families over the deceased's property.

The victim has suffered severe injuries on her back and lower portions of the body.

The victim was was also medically examined by the doctors and said to be out of danger. Later, police arrested Prabhulal and Suresh who are being interrogated and will be produced before the magistrate.
