Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			An 18-year-old girl from Sitaramdera has accused a distant uncle of sexually exploiting her for six months after making false promises of securing her jailed father's release.

The resident of New Layout lodged an FIR on Tuesday night after which Sitaramdera police registered a case of rape against D. Pal. A team led by assistant sub-inspector Sangita Kumari raided Pal's house at Baradwari adjoining New Layout but he had fled.

Pal, aged around 50, is a distant uncle of the complainant on her mother's side and is married with children. He is alleged to have developed a physical relation with the victim, a matriculate who stopped further education, by taking undue advantage of her current situation.
 
According to a relative, the girl's father, who used to work at a private company, is lodged at Ghaghidih Central Jail for the past seven months after getting arrested in a case arising out of a dispute over monetary transaction.

"The accused promised to get her father released by obtaining bail. He started taking the teenager to Jamshedpur civil court and other places on the pretext of making arrangement for the bail. Gradually, he became close to the girl and drew her into a physical relationship six months ago. Since then, he had been exploiting her," the relative added.

Sitaramdera OC Sunil Kumar Chowdhury said they had sent the victim to MGM hospital for medical examination. "He is learnt to have fled the city. If he continues to remain at large, we will move court to seek an attachment warrant against him."
