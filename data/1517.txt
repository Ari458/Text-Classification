Rape
Description:
			A 50-year-old man from Nagpur has been arrested for raping his teenage daughter repeatedly over the last five years. The girl is now two months pregnant.

The accused, Kishore Agrawal, was sexually exploiting his 19-year-old daughter for the last five years, after his wife left him. The girl was then 14-year-old. The incident came to light on Tuesday afternoon when Agrawal hit the girl in the stomach after she refused to have intercourse with him. On questioning, the girl told the neighbours about her father forcing her into a physical relationship since her mother left the house.
