Description:
			In a shocking incident, a man in Odisha's state capital allegedly tonsured his wife, used a red-hot nail to remove a black mole on her chin, stabbed her with a broken tube light and stitched her private parts after suspecting her of infidelity.

Though the incident took place on September 23, it came to light recently after the accused Ranjan Panda (40), a tent house owner, was arrested following a complaint lodged with police by his 31-year-old wife.

Ranjan married Jasoda in 2005 and they have a seven-year-old son. Panda had allegedly tortured Jasoda demanding dowry and suspected her of having an extramarital relationship.

On the night of September 23rd, Panda allegedly sedated his wife and shaved her head. He then removed a black mole on her chin with a red-hot nail, stabbed her in the stomach with a broken tube light, stitched her private parts and left her in a helpless state.

Panda's family took Jasoda to a hospital where the doctors referred her to the SCB Medical College Hospital in Cuttack after primary treatment.

The woman's family members left her at the hospital, compelling the authorities to inform her brother Mohan Mishra, who took her to another hospital and lodged a police complaint.

Jasoda alleged that when she went to the Khandagiri police station, the officers refused to accept his FIR and misbehaved with him. After much difficulty, he registered a complaint. They then referred it to the Mahila police station.
