Murder
Description:
			A local court has awarded life imprisonment to a 25-year-old man for killing his wife.

Additional Sessions Judge-III Veena Vyas yesterday sentenced Zafar Ajmeri to life imprisonment under IPC sections 302 (murder) and 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence) and also slapped a fine of Rs 30,000 on him, public prosecutor Prafulla Yajurvedi said today.

Zafar doubted the character of his wife Samina (22).

On January 29, 2013, when she had gone to her relative's house for a marriage function in the district's Badakhedi village, he called her outside the venue.

He then took her to a secluded place and attacked her with a shovel following which she died.

To cover up his crime, Zafar hid his wife's watch, mobile phone and jewellery at a poultry farm.

When he returned home alone, Samina's parents got suspicious. They later found her body buried near Ali Bohra Tota Magazine place.

Later, based on a complaint filed by Samina's parents, police arrested Zafar.

The police produced 16 witnesses, including her relatives, in the court and also submitted the victim's DNA report to prove the charges against the accused.
