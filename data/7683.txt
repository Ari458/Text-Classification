Child Sexual Abuse, Molestation, Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			A taxi driver has been arrested for sexually abusing a five-year-old girl outside a school in south Delhi's Defence Colony.

The child had complained to her mother about the cabbie upon returning home from school on Wednesday. Police said an awareness campaign on good and bad touch was held at her school last week. The girl's mother informed police on Thursday morning after which an FIR was registered.

The cabbie, Mehfooz (35), a resident of Jamia Nagar, was arrested within a few hours of the complaint. Police suspect the Class I student was being abused for some time. A police officer said that the driver had been privately hired by parents to pick up children from a private school in Sadiq Nagar and drop them off in the locality. The girl used to travel in another cab, but the man brought her to his cab and molested her.

The girl's mother, who works in a private firm, immediately contacted the school which insisted that a police case be registered. Other parents, meanwhile, caught the man and handed him over to police. A case under POCSO Act was registered.

Police said Mehfooz owned a Maruti Omni which he used for ferrying children. He initially denied the allegation but later admitted to have touched the child inappropriately. Police are probing if he abused students travelling in his own cab.
