Murder, Dowry Harassment
Description:
			Police has booked the husband and in-laws of a newly married girl for killing her for dowry and then trying to pass it off as an accident. Angry over the incident, locals blocked the Moga-Kotkapura highway and caused damage to a bus.

Family of the girl has alleged that her throat was slit with a blade and she had not died in an accident as was being claimed.

Amandeep Kaur (28) of Samalsar in Moga district got married to Gurwinder Singh of Badhni Kalan village three months ago. On Sunday the couple was going to Samalsar to meet Amandeep' parents when the car was reported to have met with an accident near Rode village on the Moga-Kotkapura highway. The girl died on the spot while Gurwinder had sustained injuries. He was taken to Bagha Purana civil hospital from where he was discharged after first aid.

However, the parents of the deceased have alleged that the girl had not died in the accident but was actually killed.

"My sister had told us that her in-laws used to harass her for dowry immediately after the marriage. Gurwinder first killed my sister with a blade and to pass off it as an accident he slammed the car into a tree. There was no major damage to the car. We have found a blade from the vehicle and there is a cut on her throat, said deceased's brother Balbir Singh.

The protesting residents blocked the highway and damaged a PRTC bus, demanding that a murder case should be registered against Amandeep' husband and in-laws. 

Moga SP (investigations) Harjeet Singh Pannu said, "As per a complaint filed by Balbir Singh, a murder case has been registered against Gurwinder Singh, his father Manjit Singh, mother Kuldeep Kaur and two sisters under the Dowry Act. Investigations in the case are on."
