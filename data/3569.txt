Description:
			A 32-year-old software professional from Hyderabad was arrested for allegedly circulating photographs of his ex-girlfriend on the internet, which prompted her to attempt suicide.

The accused B. Pradeep Kumar Reddy, previously employed at a software firm at Madhapur in the state capital, allegedly sent some objectionable photographs of the victim on the personal e-mails of her fiancee and of her relatives.

Reddy, a married man, posed himself as a bachelor and a HR professional working with a reputed software company and developed friendship with the girl around four years back.

Reddy and the victim, a resident of Gajuwaka area in city, developed a relationship which she broke off recently after coming to know that he was already married.

Reddy would seek sexual favours from the girl promising to marry her.

Even though the girl walked out on him, Reddy wanted to continue the affair and even forced her to elope with him. However, the girl refused Reddy's proposal and decided to marry another man.

When the girl discontinued her relationship with him, Reddy started making threatening calls to her and her family members. He forwarded her objectionable photos, along with abusive comments, to the e-mails of her fiancee and her relatives.

This resulted into her fiancee cancelling the marriage, which prompted the girl to attempt suicide.
