Rape
Description:
			The 28 year old mother of three was on the way to her paternal home in Shantipur's Gayenpara. Bada Seikh alias Salim, 32, offered her a lift on his cycle and she accepted. "While near Sutragarh in Nadia, he tried to rape me," alleged the Berpara resident. On hearing the woman cry, locals rushed to her rescue. But the miscreant had already fled by then.
