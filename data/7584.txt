Child Sexual Abuse, Murder, Rape
Description:
			A 9-year-old girl, whose identity has not been disclosed yet, has been raped by her 42-year-old neighbour. The incident took place in Delhi on Monday, July 13. Two days after the incident, the girl died in a hospital in the national capital on Wednesday. The victim, a class III student, was admitted to hospital as she complained of having fever and headache.

Her parents were shocked when doctors told them that the girl was raped. According to sources, doctors conducted a few tests and confirmed that she was sexually brutalised. While asked, the girl revealed everything in front of her parents. She told that she along with her friends was playing in front of their house on Monday evening.

Their neighbour, who has been identified as Muneer, approached the kids and lured the girl on the pretext of showing her something "unique". When the victim entered into his house, he gagged her mouth and took her to a nearby secluded place, where he allegedly raped her.

Death of the victim complicated the case. Police have already arrested the accused. A case under Sections 376 (Punishment for rape) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and 3/4 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (POCSO) has been registered at Khajoori Khas police station.
