Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			Five months after a case was registered against them here, the Ludhiana police today arrested a woman tutor and her two brothers on charges of sexually abusing a 14-year-old boy.

While the 35-year-old woman tutor used to allegedly sexually exploit the boy, her two brothers, Raghav (28) and Madhav (24), filmed the entire act, police said.

A case was registered five months ago at Civil Lines police station here. The trio had been absconding since then.

Police Inspector S S Juneja said the accused were nabbed at local bus stand this morning when they were about to board a Delhi-bound bus.

The case was registered after the victim, along with his parents and activists of the Bachpan Bachao Andolan, an NGO, approached the police in September last.

According to the FIR registered in the case, the woman allegedly used to show the boy pornographic films on her laptop and send him lewd messages.

The boy said that the tutor used to make physical relations with him after drugging him.

He also alleged that her brothers used to record her sexual act with him in camera. The police had registered a case against the trio under various sections of the IPC including 294 (obscene acts), 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act.

"It could be a case of preparing pornographic films," a police official said, adding in-depth investigations will be conducted into the case.
