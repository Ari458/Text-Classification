Murder, Dowry Harassment
Description:
			A 22-year-old woman, who was allegedly set on fire for dowry, succumbed to injuries at a private hospital in Bareilly on Tuesday. 

She has left behind a one-month-old daughter. 

The woman's father claimed that she had filed a dowry case against her husband and in-laws about two years back which is still pending with the court. The woman was staying with her father after being thrown out from her home. 

In a bid to protect himself and his family members, the husband had allegedly coaxed the woman and took her back home, where he allegedly set her ablaze on December 5. She sustained 90% burn injuries. 

Neuria police station station officer Rajendra Singh told TOI that the father of the deceased had neither filed any written complaint when Sunita had been set on fire nor he had submitted any complaint on her death. He said he had received a requisition from the father of deceased on Wednesday simply for a 'Punchnama' of Sunita's dead body which was mandatory for the post mortem.
