Description:
			A 25-year-old woman was found dead under mysterious circumstances at her in-laws' home in north-east Delhi's Karawal Nagar on Wednesday night. While the in-laws have told police that the woman had committed suicide, her family members say that she was forced to commit suicide after being harassed by her in-laws for dowry. 

The woman named Pooja was found hanging from the ceiling fan of her house on Thursday morning by her husband Vipin Kumar. He immediately informed the police who rushed to the spot and brought down the body and sent it for post mortem. 

Meanwhile, the family members of the woman were informed. They alleged that the in-laws have been harassing the woman for the past two year even after she had a son last year. 

They said that they were married in April 2012 following which Pooja was living with her husband and son Shubh and her in-laws at Gali No. 2 in Karawal Nagar. 

Police have registered a case under charges of dowry harassment based on the complaints filed by Pooja's family members. Her sister Madhu said Pooja even called her that morning and said her in-laws were harassing her and that she wanted to end it all.
