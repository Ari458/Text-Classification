Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A 15-year-old girl was allegedly raped in east Delhi's Pandav Nagar area with the accused in the case suspected to be a minor, police said on Saturday. The accused, a resident of a slum cluster in Shashi Garden area, has been apprehended by police, said an official.

According to police, the incident was reported yesterday evening when the girl was returning from a visit to the grocer's shop. On her way back, scared by a pack of stray dogs, she tried to hide behind some bushes near a temple when the accused pulled the girl inside his shanty, police said. His dwelling was close to the spot where the girl was hiding, they added.

It was alleged that the accused was following the girl and took advantage of the situation to drag her inside his shanty and force himself upon her, said the official. Her relatives approached police after she returned home and told her mother of her ordeal. She was subsequently taken for a medical examination, which confirmed rape, said the official.

A case was registered under relevant sections of IPC and the POCSO Act and the accused was apprehended from his house immediately. Police said it was found that the accused is addicted to drugs and often created ruckus in his slum cluster.
