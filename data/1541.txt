Description:
			Two 15 year old dalit girls appearing for their first board examinations were allegedly stripped by female invigilators while 40 male students watched. The incident took place on March 15.

A handful of girls and 40 boys of Barhebara and neighbouring villages were appearing for anexamination. The female examiners involved, Preeti Sharma and Reshma Simaiya, suspected that some students were using paper bits to copy and picked the two minor girls and asked them to strip. When the girls refused, the examiners allegedly stripped them while male classmates sniggered and cracked jokes. Nothing was found to suggest they had cheated.
