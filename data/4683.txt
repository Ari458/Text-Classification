Abduction
Description:
			An attempted rape was foiled by a routine police naka. On the night of February 11, a woman returning home was abducted in a shuttle car on EM Bypass. The kidnap was foiled when the driver was blocked at a checkpoint and then could not shake off pursuing police officers on Enfields. He dumped the woman and sped off but was tracked down and arrested early next morning.

The police commissioner has made prevention of sexual crimes a top priority for his force. He has ordered all charge-sheets to be submitted in 60-75 days and police have requested the forensic laboratory to complete their reports at the earliest. Besides increasing visibility on the roads, Kolkata Police have a response mechanism through which top officers are immediately informed about such incidents.
