Domestic Violence, Dowry Harassment
Description:
			A 25-year-old woman, Anjali Sharma, committed suicide last week in Ghansoli. Her husband, mother-in-law and sister-in-law have been booked for abetment of suicide. Police sources said that Sharma was allegedly harassed by her in-laws, both physically and mentally. 

"Sharma's father, Rajmal Mallaha (61), said that she was being harassed by her in-laws to get more money for dowry as well as to give birth to a baby boy," said Mahesh Bhavikatti, assistant police inspector. 

The mother of two girls was married to Suryaprakash (30), an employee at a local fabricator for fitting sliding windows. The two married in 2011 and the cops said her in-laws began to harass her for dowry. 

On July 13, the family discovered Sharma's body hanging from the ceiling. 

Cops said that after completing her final rites, Mallaha approached the police and accused his daughter's in-laws of abetment. "Suryaprakash's mother Basmati Sharma (50) and his sister Ramita Sharma (30) have been booked," added Bhavikatti.
