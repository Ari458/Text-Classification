Dowry Harassment
Description:
			Bhawarkuan police on Saturday registered a case against an NRI engineer and his family members for allegedly harassing an Indore-based woman for dowry for the past two years.

The victim Jasmine Kaur, 27, had submitted a complaint against her husband Harpreet Singh Khurana, now settled in USA. She got married to Harpreet on April 13, 2014 and after that they moved to Mumbai. "My in-laws demanded gold ornaments for the entire family from my father and he gave them," said Jasmine.

Jasmine's father Surjeet Singh said, "I also transferred an amount of Rs 2.25 lakh to Harpreet's account on May 15, 2014 after they demanded dowry over phone."

In February this year, Harpreet got a job in USA and he left the country without Jasmine, promising to take her with him once Surjeet Singh sends money for the same.

"We made many attempts to contact Harpreet and his family. We were told by Harpreet's uncle Surendra Singh Saluja that he wants a divorce. Her mother Manjeet Kaur also told us that they did not want to continue the relation as we were not able to give them money," said Surjit Singh.

Jasmine and her family had been approaching Mahila police station for lodging a complaint. But the case was registered only after intervention of senior officials. Jasmine also alleged that the Mahila Thana personnel tried to compel her to 'settle the matter' thus the delay in the complaint. "But we want justice," Jasmine said.
