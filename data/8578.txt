Child Sexual Abuse, Molestation
Description:
			A 40-year-old man was severely beaten-up by people after he allegedly tried to molest a four-year-old girl under Galta Gate police station area late on Tuesday night.

According to the police, Kasim used to beg outside a dargah (shrine) here in Galta Gate. "Kasim and father of the girl used to take drugs and consume alcohol together. The girl's family also used to beg outside the same dargah," a police official added.

Late on Tuesday night, the girl's mother found that Kasim was roaming around with her daughter without informing them. She accused Kasim of trying to molest her daughter. A brawl broke out between Kasim and girl's mother after she slapped him.

She told devotees and people that Kasim was attempting to rape her daughter at an isolated place. Infuriated people first hurled abuses at Kasim and when he resisted, the angry crowd started beating him up. The police reached the spot after receiving the information and took Kasim along with them.

"Primary investigation revealed that Kasim was a resident of Bangladesh. He used to consume drugs with girl's father. Even on that day, he had consumed drugs along with the father," the police said.

The mother, in her complaint to police, said that both Kasim and his husband knew each other. Kasim was admitted to SMS Medical College on Tuesday, where his condition is stated to be critical.
