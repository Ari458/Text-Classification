Abduction, Human Trafficking
Description:
			With the arrest of four persons, police today claimed to have busted a gang allegedly being operated by an advocate and his wife in neighbouring Navi Mumbai, which abducts minor girls in a bid to push them into flesh trade.

Panvel-based advocate Sanjay Bhoir, 50, his wife Ruby, 34, and his two associates Salman Khan, 21, and Kishore Thakur, 50, were caught by Mumbai Police's Crime branch, police said.

Two girls, both six-year-old, were rescued, they said.

The arrested persons were handed over to Navi Mumbai Police which placed them under arrest as the kidnapping cases of the girls were registered in their jurisdiction.

According to police, Mumbai Police's Property Cell inspector Nandkumar Gopale and his team have been working on an information that a gang has been active in kidnapping girls and pushing them in prostitution once they grow up.

"Accordingly, Gopale and his team picked up the four and rescued two girls from the lawyer's house in Uran in Navi Mumbai. While one girl was kidnapped in April 2013, the other girl in November 2013 from Navi Mumbai," city police commissioner Rakesh Maria said.

Throwing more light on the case, another police officer said that Khan and Thakur had lured the victims.

After kidnapping the two roadside girls, the accused handed them over to Bhoir couple, who paid Rs 80,000 in one case and Rs 1 lakh in another.

"Preliminary probe suggested that the couple's intention was to push the girls into flesh trade after they grow up," Maria said, adding, that further probe is being carried out by Navi Mumbai police.

The advocate's wife Ruby used to be a bar girl earlier, police said.
