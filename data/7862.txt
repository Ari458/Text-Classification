Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A man was arrested for forcing his minor girlfriend to undergo an abortion at a clinic in west Delhi's Janakpuri area. The 14-year-old girl delivered a premature child on Sunday, eight months after she became pregnant during her affair with the man who is 12 years older. A case against the clinic has been also been registered. 

The girl lives with her parents in southwest Delhi's Sitapuri area. Her father is a labourer and mother is a maid. 

The accused, Karan (26), told police that he met the girl a year ago and fell in love with her but they kept their relationship under wraps. However, the girl's parents said that the man tried to use their daughter knowing that she is a minor. "My daughter is admitted in the hospital. She has given birth to a child who might not survive," said the girl's father. 

Police said the matter came to light when the girl complained of stomach ache to her mother. After trying home remedies, her parents took her to a clinic. Doctors conducted tests and found her pregnant. 

"They said the girl was five months pregnant. Her family then decided to get the baby aborted, but the attempt failed and the doctor ended up injuring the unborn. They later realized that she had been pregnant for the past eight and not five months," said Pushpendra Kumar, DCP, west. 

Karan had also accompanied the family to the clinic, but he fled after seeing the condition of the girl and the child. 

The girl's parents then called up the police. She was moved to Deen Dayal Upadhyay hospital where she delivered the underdeveloped baby. 

"Late at night police arrested the accused and a case was lodged under IPC Section 376 (rape) and under POCSO. A case against the clinic was lodged under IPC sections 313 (causing miscarriage without woman's consent), 511and 120b (criminal conspiracy)," Kumar said.
