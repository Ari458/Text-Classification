Domestic Violence, Murder
Description:
			A man had been arrested in Kanyakumari for murdering his wife and stage-managing the death to make it seem like it was a heart attack.

31-year-old David Samuel from Thirivattar was married to 26-year-old Hephzibah for the past 2 years. Recently, Hephzibah's parents passed away and David asked her sister Sibia and her brother Medusala to come and stay with them.

In the morning on October 28, people heard David yelling out that Hephzibah was lying motionless and could feel no sensation. When her relatives went to check what had happened, they realised Hephzibah was dead.

David said that she was having a severe chest pain and had taken some pills before going to sleep the other night.

HEPHZIBAH'S BROTHER SUSPECTS FOUL PLAY

He made others believe that she had died of a cardiac arrest. But Hephzibah's brother suspected some foul play and filed a complaint with the Thirivattar police and stopped Hephzibah's funeral.

Thirivattar police inspector seized Hephzibah's body and sent it for autopsy, despite opposition from David and his family.

And as Medusela suspected, the autopsy revealed that Hepzibah had been strangled to death. Police arrested David immediately. 

DAVID CONFESSES TO MURDER

On being interrogated, he revealed that he was not happy living with Hepzibah and had started loving his sister-in-law Sibia.

Hepzibah's brother Medusala said, "On 28th morning, we got a phone call that my sister passed away. I couldn't believe the news and when I went there, I was sure something was wrong. David didn't seem to be worried about her death, so we filed a complaint with the police. His family opposed going for the post-mortem, but the police went ahead with it. They found a mark on her neck and David ultimately confessed to having killed Hepzibah by strangling her. I hope David is hanged or killed by public execution. I don't want any other woman suffering such a fate".
