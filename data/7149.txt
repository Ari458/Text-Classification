Description:
			Reportedly depressed over the alleged harassment by a police constable, a 17-year-old girl, who was in love with the constable, was found hanging in her room at her house in Kumpala in Ullal police station limits on Wednesday around 7 a.m.

Her mother, a retired teacher, had gone for her morning walk when the incident occurred. When she returned home, the house was found locked from the inside. She took the help of neighbours to break open the door only to find her daughter dead in the room.

Assistant Commissioner of Police (South) Kalyan Shetty said that they have recovered a note purportedly written by the girl where she has alleged harassment by Praveen Salian, a District Armed Reserve constable deputed as security guard to Vijay Bank branch in Puttur.

The girl has, in the note, said that she came in contact with Salian through Facebook and fell in love. Salian, she alleged, harassed her after she went to meet her friends.

He, the girl said, demanded Rs. 1 lakh or gold for not revealing their relationship to her family members.

Mr. Kalyan Shetty said that she was a student of first year of B.Com in a city college. A few days ago she had revealed to her friends the harassment allegedly caused by Salian. On a complaint, the Ullal police have registered a case against Salian. He has been taken into police custody for investigation, Mr. Kalyan Shetty said.
