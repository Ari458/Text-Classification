Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			Two men were on Thursday arrested for facilitating the escape of Father Edwin Figarez, an accused in a child abuse case. 

Both the arrested men are Edwin's relatives, police said, while identifying them as Thrissur residents Silvesto Figarez (58), brother of the Puthenvelikkara church priest and Ben Gari Figarez (22). 

Police have also confiscated the car in which the duo allegedly facilitated the escape of Edwin to Bengaluru, from where the priest fled the country to the UAE. Investigators said Ben drove the car with the priest on April 1, a day before Edwin flew out of the country. 

After reaching the Middle East, the priest moved a bail application in the high court. The court ordered the police to not arrest him till May 5. The priest, who returned to the state by April-end, gave his statement to investigators before giving the police the slip before May 5. 

Police said more relatives of Edwin would be arrested. 

It has been alleged that the priest sexually abused a 14-year-old girl at Puthenvelikkara.
