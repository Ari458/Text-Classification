Child Sexual Abuse, Murder
Description:
			A 35-year-old man has been arrested for killing a 10-year-old girl  after she resisted his attempt to rape her at her house in Pul Prahladpur in south-east Delhi, police said on Sunday.

Police said the accused Gopal, 35, who hails from Bihar’s Katihar district, was earlier also arrested for rape and molestation.

According to Ajay Chaudhry, additional commissioner of police (south-east), action was taken after the minor girl’s body was found by her brother in a dustbin near Railway Colony in Pul Prahladpur late on Saturday.

“A case of murder was lodged over a complaint by her brother,” Chaudhry said. Police later found out that the girl’s neighbour, Gopal, was absconding. 

“Finding her alone, he tried to misbehave with her. She objected to it and told him that she would inform her brother,” Chaudhry said.

Furious over this, Gopal attacked her with a wooden bread-roller. He then took her to a nearby place and crushed her head with a stone.
