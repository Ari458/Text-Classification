Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			At a time when her peers are drowned in studies for the upcoming Secondary School Certificate (SSC) examinations, a 15-year-old girl from Kalyan has taken sick after being repeatedly raped by her father for two weeks. The accused raped his daughter on several afternoons, when his wife was away at work. He has been arrested by police officers from Kolsewadi police station.

On January 10, the girl returned from school, ate her lunch and sat down for studies. However, since she was tired, she decided to take a nap instead. The victim's father, employed with a theatre company, was home, too. Once she fell asleep, the accused approached her and forced her to have sex with him. Hapless, she fell in the trap. After the horrific act was over, the accused threatened his daughter with dire consequences if she confided in anyone.

The girl silently bore the ordeal and lived in the fear of her father all this while. However, when the accused raped her again on January 10, the girl decided to break her silence. She confided in her friend, who in turn helped her approach her mother. Aghast, the victim's mother burst into tears and wasted no time in lodging a police complaint. The accused was nabbed soon after and taken to the police station.

A police official from Kolsewadi, Kalyan says, "We have lodged a complaint and have nabbed the culprit. We have sent both, the accused and his daughter, for a medical test and are awaiting the reports. The girl has taken sick after the news broke out."
