Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			As many as twelve female staff members working at the BMC-run KEM hospital have come together to take on their male colleague whom they have accused of sexually harassing them at work.

Though the complaint was filed against the senior technician in question with the head of Biochemistry Department Dr Sucheta Dandekar, and orders to transfer him to Pathology department were subsequently issued, he has refused to accept the orders.

According to the staff members who have filed the complaint, the senior technician makes derogatory remarks against his female colleagues.

However, it is not known since when the senior technician has been involved in making such snide comments against his subordinate female colleagues.

The Complaints Committee of KEM Hospital, which has BMC officials and doctors as its members, is looking into the matter.

Dr Dandekar's letter to the Dean of the hospital states that the lab technician was transferred to the Pathology department following complaints against him and as per the action initiated by Anti-Sexual Harassment Committee, but has refused to accept the transfer orders.

BMC is the only civic body to have a prevention of sexual harassment policy in place. No other civic body has such type of policy to counter sexual harassment.
