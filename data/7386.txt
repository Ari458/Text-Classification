Rape
Description:
			A man allegedly involved in the gangrape of a 20-year-old woman in Mari Mustafa village was arrested in Moga even as raids were conducted on Friday to trace the four other accused who are on the run.
"Jaswant Singh has been arrested in the gangrape case," IG (Bathinda zone) PS Umranangal said. He said the police teams have been carrying out raids to arrest others involved in the case.
In her complaint, the victim alleged that she had gone to her friend Sarabjit's residence with a male friend on Wednesday and they decided to stay there as the friend's husband identified as Jaswant Singh was not at home.

However, Jaswant returned home late at night with a group of around eight friends. They allegedly thrashed the victim's male friend who sustained a fracture in the leg. The victim said that she was then taken to a tubewell outside the village where she was allegedly gangraped.
Police said that a medical board had been constituted to examine the victim. A case of rape has been registered against Jaswant Singh and several others.
