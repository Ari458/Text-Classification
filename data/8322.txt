Molestation
Description:
			The City Chowk police on Monday arrested two brothers, who are suspected land sharks and wanted by the police since June 2015 for their their alleged involvement in extortion and molestation cases.

The arrested accused are Sattar Khan Khwaja Khan and Gaffar Khan Khwaja Khan, both residents of Khokadpura in the Paithan Gate area.

On June 29 last year, the City chowk police registered a case under section 354 (molestation) of the IPC against the accused for allegedly misbehaving with a 38-year-old woman.

The woman stated in her complaint to the police that Sattar Khan took her shop on rent by formally entering into an agreement, but his brother took possession of the shop and stopped paying rent.

Besides, a case of extortion was also registered against the duo for allegedly trying to extort Rs 5 lakh from a 62-year-old man, a resident of Khokadpura.

In his complaint to the city police commissioner Amitesh Kumar, the man stated that he owns a plot in the area and decided to construct a house for his grandchildren.

However, the accused allegedly started demanding Rs 5 lakh for allowing him to continue the construction work. After the man refused to bend down to the extortion demands, the accused allegedly filed a litigation in court claiming to be the owner of the land, following which an injunction order was given.
Taking serious note of the complaint, Kumar asked the EOW to conduct a detailed probe to ascertain the facts.
