Description:
			A mahila court in Tamil Nadu has sentenced a man to double life imprisonment for raping his 16-year-old daughter and then murdering her after she became pregnant.

Mahila court judge Muthu Sarah convicted and sentenced the man to 53 years in jail -- double life imprisonment and 25 years in jail on charges of sexually abusing the girl, rape, and attempted destruction of evidence.

He was sentenced to double life imprisonment for murdering the girl and for murdering the child she was carrying. The 25-year jail term was handed for threatening and raping his daughter and sexually abusing her in 2010.

According to the prosecution, 43-year-old Roosevelt Anbaiyan, an ex-serviceman, sexually abused his daughter and then murdered her after he discovered she was four months pregnant.

After Roosevelt's first wife died in 2007, his in-laws took his daughter under their care. But he brought back his daughter and married another woman a few years ago.

But on May 29, 2010, the body of the daughter was found in a water tank in their house following which Roosevelt lodged a police complaint.

During the probe, police's suspicion turned to Roosevelt and the post-mortem report revealed that the girl was four months pregnant.

Roosevelt later confessed to police that he had sexually abused his daughter. He said that after he realised that she was pregnant, he decided to murder her before her school reopened on June 1.

The prosecution said that Roosevelt made his daughter drink coffee laced with sleeping tablets and, when she became unconscious, raped her, removed her clothes and jewels, strangled her and then threw the body into the tank.
