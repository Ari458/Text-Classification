Abduction, Murder
Description:
			Police arrested two people on the charges of murdering a 22-year-old girl who was found dead in an orchard in Dangiwacha area of Baramulla district.

Mohammad Shafi Dar and Mehrajuddin Dar were arrested after they confessed to murdering Nayeema Mohiuddin on November 21.

Police started investigations after Nayeema's body was recovered from an orchard in Dangiwacha.

During the course of investigation it surfaced that the victim was in a relationship with Shafi, a resident of Chankhan, Sopore. They had developed this relationship at their workplace, a private school in Sopore where the deceased was working as Helper and Shafi was working as a driver.

Call detail records of the deceased and Shafi revealed that they used to talk on phone for hours during night. Shafi had left the job some months ago.

Of late, Shafi had felt that the girl was no more interested in him and was suspecting her of having an affair with some other person and as such had developed ill will and resentment against her.

On the fateful day, Shafi along with his friend Mehrajuddin picked up the victim in a van from Sopore town and forcibly took her to an orchard near village Seelu.

Shafi assaulted her in the vehicle and then the duo forced the girl to come out of the van. The girl, sensing their intentions, resisted and tried to call for help. However the duo overpowered her and strangulated her with her head scarf to death.
