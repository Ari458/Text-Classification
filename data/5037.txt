Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A 25-year-old taxi driver was arrested by the Goregaon police on Sunday for allegedly raping his live-in partner's minor daughter at their home on several occasions.

According to the police, the 15-year-old daughter of Nilesh Kamble's partner ran away from her home on June 17 after she failed her SSC examinations. She was spotted by a woman at Andheri railway station, who took her to an NGO. "The girl was then taken to a children's home in Dongri. When the home's probationary officers asked her what had happened, she told them that she had been sexually assaulted by her mother's live-in partner several times. They immediately informed us," said Sunil Wadke, senior police inspector of Goregaon police station. Kamble was then arrested from Prem Nagar early on Sunday.

The victim said that Kamble had raped her on three different occasions since December last year when she was alone at her home in a Goregaon (West) slum. The girl's mother works as a maid. "We are investigating if Kamble has assaulted her on more occasions. He started living with the victim's mother after she lost her husband," said Wadke.

Kamble was arrested under section 376 (punishment for rape) of the Indian Penal Code and other relevant sections of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. A holiday court remanded him to police custody.
