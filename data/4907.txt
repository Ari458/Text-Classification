Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A 3-year-old girl was allegedly raped by her 35-year-old neighbour on June 4 in Bhoura colony under Jorakhpur police station of the district. The news sparked tension in the locality as hundreds reached Bhoura outpost seeking immediate action against the culprit. Police have booked Ansari, who fled the colony ever since the incident came to light, on charges of child assault and rape.

According to reports, the survivor, who had gone to her grandmother's place in Bhoura, was allegedly assaulted sexually by Aurangzeb Ansari alias Zeba (35) when her mother was not at home. Shewas lured with chocolates and taken to a secluded place by Ansari to escape prying eyes.

The survivor narrated the whole story to her aunt on her return and the family confronted the family of the accused. However, the accused first offered a financial assistance of Rs 20,000 and later threatened them with dire consequences. Fearing the worst, the girl along with her mother returned to their native place quietly.

However, the news soon spread in the locality by word of mouth and people started reacting to the incident vociferously. The locals called on the family of the survivor asking them to lodge a complaint against the culprit. "This is perhaps the most heinous crime afflicting society. This cannot be tolerated," said ward councillor Chandan Mahto.

Officer in-charge Shanker Oraon, when contacted, said police have lodged a case under section 376 of IPC and section 8 of Protection Of Children from Sexual Offence (POCSO) Act 2012. Ansari is on the run and we will conduct raids to trace him, he added.
