Rape
Description:
			A 21-year-old second year LLB student has filed a rape complaint against a man whom she had befriended a day ago while returning home. Supriya (name changed) has stated that she was raped after offering alcohol.

Sonegaon police have registered an offence even as medical test will be conducted later. The so-called rape complaint is, however, seems to be not beyond doubt. Supriya could not furnish much details of the accused, Rakesh Lakhate, before the police. She stated that Lakhate could be staying at Shatabdi Nagar. Police are however not confident about the authenticity of the name and locality of the accused as furnished by Supriya. She was unsure of his mobile phone number too, said a senior police officer.

It has come to fore that Supriya had met Lakhate by chance on June 23. Lakhate offered Supriya lift on his bike when she was walking home. Police said Lakhate asked Supriya her mobile phone number after dropping her at the doorstep.

The following day, Supriya got a call from Lakhate who requested her to come along for a dinner at a roadside dhaba on Wardha Road. It was at the eatery that Lakhate offered Supriya liquor. They both consumed liquor.

Lakhate later took Supriya to an unoccupied and unlocked house of Mihan rehabilitation scheme's residential complex. Supriya was forced to have physical relationship at one of the unlocked and unoccupied houses.

Police said Supriya went to the police station after two days with family members as she was feeling guilty. Police took Supriya for medical test after the offence was registered.
