Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			The Kurar police on Saturday arrested a youth working as a helper in a school jeep for allegedly sexually assaulting a three-year-old minor girl on Friday in Malad (East).

According to the Kurar police, the victim, who studies in a nursery school in Malad (East) finished her classes on Friday afternoon and stepped out. She approached the jeep that would ferry her from the school back home. "The youngster, who worked as attendant in the jeep, took the child to an isolated place under the pretext of taking her to urinate and sexually abused her," said Raghvendra Thakur, senior police inspector of Kurar police station.

On Friday night, the three-year-old victim started crying hysterically after which her parents rushed her to a private hospital. At the hospital, the doctor while carrying out a medical examination smelt a rat and referred the child to a government-run hospital. "During the check-up, a doctor realised that the child had been sexually assaulted after which they informed us and we registered a case," said Sr PI Thakur. He added: "On being prodded, the child narrated her ordeal to her parents. On Saturday, a case was registered and the accused was arrested." The Kurar police believe that the accused might be a minor himself and are ascertaining his age.

The Kurar police booked the accused under section 376 (rape) and relevant sections of Protection of Children Against Sexual Offences (POCSO).
