Molestation
Description:
			The lady principal of a central school today attempted suicide by consuming a poisonous substance here, and later accused the Panna district collector of sexual harassment.

Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has ordered immediate transfer of the collector in view of the incident, a senior official said.

The woman, in her statement to the media at the district hospital where she was admitted, alleged that the collector R K Mishra called her to his residence and tried to sexually exploit her.

The incident disturbed her a great deal and subsequently she tried to commit suicide, she said.

Collector Mishra, however, said the allegations were "baseless" and it was an attempt to damage his reputation as a part of a conspiracy.

A woman sub-inspector attached to Kotwali police station recorded the complainant's statement and initiated a probe.

State Congress chief spokesperson K K Mishra termed the incident as serious, saying that women's security was a major challenge for the state government.

"If police acted in such an irresponsible manner with a woman principal, then one can imagine how they deal with other women," he said.
