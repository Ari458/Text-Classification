Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			In yet another incident of sexual assault, an eight-year-old schoolgirl was raped by a middle-aged person in Delhi's Okhla area, a report said on Wednesday.

The incident happened on Tuesday when the 45-year-old accused, a neighbour of the victim, went to her school at 1 pm posing as a relative of minor girl.

After reaching the school, he told the authorities that he had come to receive the girl. As the girl knew him, she willingly agreed to go with him.

However, instead of taking the 8-year-old to her residence, the accused took her to a small jungle behind the school and sexually assaulted her.

Reports also say that the accused tried to kill the schoolgirl fearing she would tell everybody.

The accused reportedly stabbed the girl and later tried to smash her head with stone.

Meanwhile, the girl has been admitted to All India Institutes of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) and undergoing treatment.

The Delhi Police has a launched a manhunt to nab the absconding accused.
