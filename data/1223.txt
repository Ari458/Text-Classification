Description:
			The 14-year-old girl's mother died some years ago and she lived with her father, who allegedly tortured her physically. Unable to bear the suffering, she fled from her residence on May 26 2011. After staying at her paternal aunt's house for three months the girl again fled from there worried that her father might find her, and was spotted at a bus shelter by a woman who offered her a job at her residence in Munirka. She stayed there for some time and was then handed over to one Rajkumar, who took her to his residence in Dwarka. The girl alleged that Rajkumar, who claimed to be a cab driver, raped her several times over a period of time. 

The incident came to light when the girl had got a two-year-old baby (Rajkumar who told her that he had found the baby and was going to raise her) admitted to the All-India Institute of Medical Sciences' Trauma Centre a few days ago with serious injuries, including human bite marks all over her body.
