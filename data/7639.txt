Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A 50-year-old man was arrested yesterday on charges of raping a 10-year-old in the Kalaigaon area of Udalguri.

Bhabi Ram Rabha, 50, of Tokankata in Udalguri, allegedly raped the Class V student on Thursday night when she was alone in her home. Sources said the victim knew the accused. Local residents caught Rabha after the girl told her family and thrashed him before handing him over to police.

Sources said the accused had allegedly sexually abused the girl earlier as well.


A case has been registered against Rabha under Sections 152, 448 and 376 of IPC and Sections 7 and 8 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012, at Kalaigaon police station.

"We have registered a case and the culprit is in police custody," said a senior police officer investigating the incident.

Various local organisations today demanded stern action against the culprit.

'We want the accused to get maximum punishment," said a local resident.

The Kokrajhar district sessions judge on Thursday sentenced Jawngbam Narzary to 10-years' rigorous imprisonment and fine of Rs 5,000 on charges of raping a 12-year-old in 2012.
