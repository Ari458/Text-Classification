Dowry Harassment
Description:
			The Immigration officials at the International Airport in Chennai have detained a man, who had been booked in a dowry harassment case by Paramakudi police and had been evading arrest for more than two years after jumping bail.

Paramakudi All Women Police registered a First Information Report (FIR) against A. Oliullah in July 2010 for deserting his wife along with two children after she failed to get him money for going abroad, and remarrying another woman.

A month after the police booked the case, Oliullah obtained anticipatory bail from the local sessions court, and even as the case was pending trial, he jumped bail and went to Saudi Arabia in 2013, the police said.

After he failed to appear before the court following summons, the sessions court issued a non-bailable arrest warrant against him on October 7, 2013.


After finding that the accused had gone abroad, the district police issued a Lookout Circular against him and alerted all airports in the country.

Meanwhile, Ali returned to the country on Friday after more than two years, and the Immigration officials detained him soon after he landed at Chennai airport from Saudi Arabia on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the police said.

A police team left for Chennai to secure the arrest of the accused.

The accused was charged under Sections 498 (a), 506(ii) and 4 of the Dowry Prohibition Act, the police said.
