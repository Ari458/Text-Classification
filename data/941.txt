Murder, Rape
Description:
			Akash Kawrati, 27, labourer, who came from neighbouring state of Chhattisgarh along with wife and two children, about six months ago. Ravindra Sharmate, another farm labourer in the village, had befriended Kawrati who belonged to the same community.

As Bagde(a common friend) took Kawrati away to buy somethings from the market, Wagh and Sharmate who were at the residence of Kawrati took the opportunity to molest Prema(Kawrati's Wife). Police said that Wagh had already raped Prema. Sharmate was forcing himself upon Prema when Kawrati and Bagde returned.

Catching Sharmate in the act, an enraged Kawrati immediately attacked him with axe and stones and killed him. While others escaped.
