Foeticide/Infanticide
Description:
			An activist-aided sting operation had some months ago led a civic team to seize the sonography machine from gynaecologist Dr Ivon Rocha, a consultant at J P hospital. He had allegedly conducted the sonography on the woman and referred her to the hospital at Saki Naka in Andheri, where he would perform the abortion, said advocate Zarir Engineer, who appeared for the BMC in court. It was a female foetus, he said.
