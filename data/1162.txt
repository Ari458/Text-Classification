Abuse
Description:
			Dr Aparna Mahangade was allegedly beaten up after attending a residential workshop. Aparna, who is associated with the Satara branch of the sanstha as a disciple, reportedly attended the workshop without informing her parents.

"At the police station, Aparna clearly told the police that it was her wish to attend the workshop and she should not be prevented from pursuing her wish. But her uncle managed to convince the police and told them that they will not allow her to continue and sought permission to beat her up in one of the rooms at the Panvel police station. Later she was asked to give a statement that she was going with her parents as per her own wish." ~ Victim's Brother
