Murder, Crime
Description:
			A 54-year-old woman, working with MTNL, was allegedly murdered in her house in Shakarpur, East Delhi.

Shanti Devi lived on the ground floor of her four-storey house in Shakarpur. The incident came to light after her son discovered the body lying in a pool of blood.

Her throat was slit with a sharp edged weapon.

The victim's family also lived with her, but no one was present in the house at the time of incident.

Family members have alleged that Rs 23 lakh in cash was missing from the house and Devi could be a victim of a property dispute.

The police, initiating the probe, recorded the statement of family members, but was yet to confirm the motive behind the crime as the house bore no signs of ransacking.

The neighbours had claimed that they saw Devi walking in front of her house around 9:30pm.

She used to walk everyday after dinner. When her son raised an alarm the neighbours called up the police.

Devi had sold a property at Ram Park a few months back and kept the money at home, according to sources.
