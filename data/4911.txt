Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A minor girl was allegedly raped by a man on the pretext of offering her a job at Marredpally area of the city.

"Following a complaint by the girl's parents, police had registered a case on June 11 under Nirbhaya Act against S Harikrishna," said Marredpally SHO B Ravindra Reddy.

However, the allegations of rape are yet to be confirmed as the medical examination of the girl did not reveal anything conclusive.

In her complaint, the girl had alleged that Harikrishna had taken money from her and promised to give her a job, but later went back on his word, police said, adding that when the girl raised the issue with him, the accused allegedly confined her in a room and raped her.

Harikrishna, who according to some reports is a politician, is absconding. However, police dismissed the reports.
