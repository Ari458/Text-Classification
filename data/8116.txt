			The Kazhakoottam police on Thursday launched a manhunt for an unidentified person who assaulted a 81-year-old woman by throwing acid on her face in her residence. The victim has been identified as Kamalamma, a resident of Nila Nagar, Kazhakoottam. She has been admitted to the CSI Mission Hospital, Kazhakoottam. Her condition is said to be out of danger, hospital sources said. According to the police, Kamalamma who was living alone allowed four Technopark employees to reside along with her as paying guests.  

When the police took statements from Kamalamma, she said she was attacked by an youngster said to be in his 20s after he was refused a room in her residence. On Tuesday, the person reached her residence and requested a room facility. She refused it as there was no space to accommodate one more person. Apparently she was attacked after the accused threw acid on her.
