Description:
			A 26-year-old man has been arrested for harassing his wife B Thilagavathi (24). The victim had married Saminathan who worked as a daily wage labourer about a month ago.

After their marriage, he stopped working. Unable to run the family, Thilagavathi advised him to go to work. However, he refused and instead persuaded her to earn a living.

When Thilagavathi refused, he got angry and beat her up. Unable to bear the torture, she went to her mother's house at Kannampalayam. When she returned to Sulur again, Saminathan started torturing her and demanded money for liquor. He beat her up when she refused his requests.
