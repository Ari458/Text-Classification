Description:
			An 11-year-old girl today died here, two days after she was found with severe burn injuries at her house after allegedly having been thrashed by a policeman.

Assistant sub-inspector Prakash Jaroliya had allegedly beaten up Yasmeen (11) for riding his bicycle without permission.

"The doctors at Maharaja Yeshwantrao Hospital tried hard to save Yasmeen, who has 100 per cent burn injuries, but could not, " superintendent of police R C Rajput said.

Citing eyewitnesses, he said the ASI lost his cool when he saw Yasmeen riding his bicycle on January 29 in Sikandrabad colony. He thrashed her and threatened to file a case of bicycle theft against her and her family members and send them to jail.

Rajput said that prime facie it appeared that the girl was too frightened by the threat, and set herself afire.

The police were waiting for autopsy report before initiating criminal proceedings against Jaroliya, the SP said.

Jaroliya and his family members were untraceable and their house was found to be locked, he said.

Rehana Bi, Yasmeen's mother, however alleged that it was Jaroliya who set her daughter on fire. She herself was not at home at the time, she said.
