Description:
			A woman attempted to commit suicide here on Saturday allegedly due to sexual harassment by a youth.

Police said Kumaram Nagamani alias Sravani, a resident of Mogalarajpuram, was married to one Naga Malleswara Rao four years ago. She poured kerosene on her person and set herself afire when her husband went out to buy vegetables. She was admitted to hospital.

In her complaint to the Machavaram police, the woman - Nagamani - said a youth Koteswara Rao alias Chitti, a contract employee with APSRTC, used to harass her with phone calls and lewd messages seeking sexual favours. "When I countered him strongly, he started spreading rumours that I had an illicit affair with another person. He even sent messages to my husband threatening him that he would leak the information to others. With this, my husband started doubting me and we had quarrels," she said.
