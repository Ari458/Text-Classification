Rape
Description:
			A 13-year-old girl was allegedly gang-raped by four people, including three juveniles, in a village of the district.
	
The victim, a resident of MPV-29 village, had been on a visit to nearby MPV-33 village eight days ago to witness a yatra when she was forcibly taken to an isolated area by the four accused and sexually assaulted by them.
	
The class VIII student's health kept on deteriorating after the incident, which made her parents even refer her to black magicians and quacks for treatment.
	
On being repeatedly quizzed by her mother, the girl finally narrated the incident, following which a case was registered.
	
The girl was first admitted at a government hospital in Kalimela but later shifted to the district headquarters hospital after her condition became serious.
	
Though the girl was unable to speak, she had named three of the four people in slurred voice.
