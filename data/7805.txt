			The body of a woman was found in Taladanda canal near Kharipadia village under Raghunathpur police limits on Thursday. Locals found the body floating in the canal and informed her in-laws and police who retrieved the body with help of fire brigade.

Sources said the woman identified as Rekha Mallick of Chanchapada village under Kishornagar police limits allegedly committed suicide by jumping into the canal over a marital dispute on Wednesday night.

Rekha had married Duryodhan Mallick of Kharipadia village in 2004. After a few months of marriage, Duryodhan developed a relationship with another woman Rosalin and married her as second wife.

The body has been sent to hospital for autopsy to ascertain the cause of death.
