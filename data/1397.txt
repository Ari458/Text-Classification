Abuse
Description:
			What is shocking is that the 21-year old herself is allegedly a victim of sexual abuse by three Rajasthan policemen.  The police claim the woman is involved in the kidnapping and sexual abuse of another woman. Her parents alleged that she was being falsely implicated in another case so that the three arrested policemen could walk free.

She lost both her legs after she jumped in front of a train in January 2011, upset over allegedly being beaten and sexually humiliated by the policemen. 

But police have said that they responded to the Rajasthan High Court's order seeking arrest of all accused in the other woman's sexual abuse case.
