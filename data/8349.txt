Rape
Description:
			The city police have arrested a factory employee for duping and raping a woman on the pretext of marrying her.

The accused has been identified Sukhwinder Singh, a resident of Jassian Road.

A case was registered on the complaint of the woman who was working at the same factory unit on Hussainpur road.

The victim said she met Sukhwinder nearly two years ago, adding that the accused told her that he was a bachelor. Both of them started meeting each other even after work and they fell in love.

She said Sukhwinder solemnised marriage with her and developed physical relations nearly one-and-a-half years ago. The victim said Sukhwinder arranged a room for her where he could stay for the time being.

She said Sukhwinder sometimes missed work and did not even visit home at night.

She reported the matter to the police. Following investigation, the Ladhowal police registered a case and started investigation.

The accused was arrested and presented before the court from where he was sent to judicial remand.
