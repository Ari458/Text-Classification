Molestation, Crime
Description:
			A 27-year-old man was arrested for allegedly molesting a foreign national woman and attacking her three friends with a knife late Sunday night in a restaurant in Mundhwa. 

Ali Chaklani, a resident of East Street in Camp, has been charged under sections 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) and 307 (attempt to murder) of the Indian Penal Code. He has been sent to police custody till August 28, said V A Ingle, sub-inspector of the Mundhwa police station. 

Jay Haresh Sumayya, 38-year-old resident of Andheri, Mumbai, lodged the complaint against the suspect on Monday but police got the details only on Thursday. 

Ingle said that on Sunday night, Sumayya, his foreign national friend and two more friends, Alap Joshi and Viven Kedari, had gone to the restaurant for dinner. Chaklani was also there. 

While they were having dinner, the suspect allegedly pushed the woman. When Sumayya confronted him, the suspect pushed and brushed against her again, which triggered a fight between Sumayya and Chaklani, he said. 

"Chaklani ran into the kitchen and came out with a knife. He threatened to kill Sumayya and attacked him. Sumayya's head got injured in the fight. When Joshi and Kedari went to help, Chaklani attacked them with the knife," Ingle said. 

Kedari sustained injury near his nose, while Joshi's left wrist was wounded in the attack. "They were taken to a nearby hospital and are out of danger," Ingle said. 

The suspect was arrested on Monday night after receiving the complaint from Sumayya. "Chaklani helps his father in their family steel business," he said. 

The complainant and the foreign national woman stay in Mumbai. "We are investigating further," Ingle added.
