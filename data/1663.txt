Rape
Description:
			A drunk man allegedly raped his 65-year-old mother-in-law. The victim, who is a TB patient, filed a complaint with the Koradi police accusing Ramesh Gawhane of committing the heinous act. 

A father of three, 46-year-old Gawhane, is absconding. The incident took place on Monday night while Gawhane's wife had gone to drop her daughter at her in-laws residence in Katol. The victim said Gawhane returned home heavily drunk at around 11pm.
