Rape
Description:
			A 19-year-old girl was allegedly raped by her uncle here, police said today. 

According to the complaint lodged yesterday at the Civil Lines police station, the incident took place on June 30 when the girl was alone at her home and her 40-year-old uncle barged into the house along with his wife on the pretext of greeting her, SP Omkar Singh said. 

According to the victim, her aunt (uncle's wife) was guarding the door while her uncle forced himself on her. 

Meanwhile, the aunt has also lodged a complaint of rape against the girl's father and brother. 

In her statement, the aunt has said that on June 30 she and her husband went to the girl's house to hold talks on a matter of property dispute, police said. 

When her husband left the house for some work, the girl's father and brother allegedly raped her, police said. 

The allegations seem to be a result of an old case of property dispute between the two groups. There have also been physical fights between the two sides in the past, Singh said. 

We have registered the complaints and investigation into the cases is on, he said.
