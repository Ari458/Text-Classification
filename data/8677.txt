Description:
			Two men were booked by the Satara police on Saturday for allegedly assaulting and molesting a 36-year-old woman for not paying her debt of Rs 3 lakh entirely.

Police said that the woman had taken a loan of Rs 3 lakh for treating her ailing son from Sakhahari Lokhande, a resident of Bokudjalgaon in Paithan taluka. She had already paid him back Rs 2.25 lakh and given a cheque of Rs 50,000.

On Saturday, Lokhande barged into her house along with an unidentified man asking for the remaining amount.

He insisted her to give him the remaining amount instantly and said that he would see how could she refuse. Subsequently, Lokhande grabbed her hand and drew her toward him while threatening with dire consequences. He also allegedly told her he would make difficult the life of her husband, who is a government servant. He also told the woman that she would incur defamation if she approached the police. He subsequently left while threatening her with dire consequences.

The police said they have registered an offence against Lokhande and his accomplice under section 452 (house-trespass after preparation for hurt, assault or wrongful restraint) 354 (outraging modesty), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) and 34 (common intention).
