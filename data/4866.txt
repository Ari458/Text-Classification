Description:
			A minor boy was sodomised allegedly by a 28-year-old man for over a month in suburban Bandra.

The accused, Irfan Salim Khan, a resident of Bandra, was arrested last night after the parents of the child filed a complaint against him at Nirmal Nagar police station, a police official said.
