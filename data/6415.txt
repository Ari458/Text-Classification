Rape
Description:
			A 27-year-old woman has alleged that she was raped by a man on the pretext of marriage for six years, police said today.

In her complaint, the woman alleged that the accused Dev Bhattacharya raped her since 2009 on the pretext of marriage, they said.

The victim, a resident of Sector-29, said that Dev pressurised her to marry him after they met in 2009 but she turned down his proposal.

Later, he called the victim to his place in 2011 where he allegedly raped her.
