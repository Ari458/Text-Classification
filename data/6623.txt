Murder
Description:
			The body of a 32-year-old woman was found in a semi-nude state this morning in south Delhi's Sangam Vihar area, police said.

According to police, the woman, a local, was found dead inside a vacant plot with a blunt force injury to her head.

Although the victim's clothes were found in a dishevelled condition, police have prima facie ruled out sexual assault.

But officials said that a clearer picture would emerge only after an autopsy.

Police said that the victim had got married a couple of years back but started living with her two brothers, identified as Dharmendra (35) and Vijay (33), after her relations soured with her husband.

"The incident came to light around 8 AM when a passerby found the body lying in a pool of blood following which he made a PCR call. She was identified by the locals and a case under Sec 302 (murder) of IPC against unknown persons was registered. The body has been sent for a post-mortem," police said.

One of her brothers ran an automobile workshop in Khanpur and the victim used to carry tiffin for them every afternoon.

"Her brother claims she had gone to the shop yesterday afternoon and stayed back while they came back and went to sleep. They came to know about the incident in the morning," he added.

Investigators said that the role of the two brothers as well as that of their neighbours, with whom they had a tiff over the plot of land on which their shanty is built, is also under the scanner.

"Her brothers say they suspect their neighbour, who had allegedly hit the woman on her head some time back. The neighbour had asked the brothers to sell them their plot, but was told a no by the duo," the official said.
