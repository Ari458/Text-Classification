Abuse
Description:
			The city police on Wednesday arrested an advocate for harassing a woman from Delhi by sending her abusive and vulgar text messages.

The accused M Abhishek (38) of Barkatpura and his friends went to an event at Gachibowli in January and introduced themselves to the woman as media personnel. When she did not respond, Abhishek obtained her business card from some persons at the venue. “He started sending her text messages. As the woman did not respond, he sent her abusive and vulgar messages asking her to respond to him,” the officer said.

The woman then informed the matter to her friends, who in turn called up the advocate and asked him not to harass her. “The victim also requested him to stop sending messages as she was not interested in him. But, he did not stop and further started threatening her saying he will come to her place personally if she does not accept his friendship,” Ms. Lakra said.

On a complaint made by the SHE Teams registered a case against Abhishek arrested after investigation, she said.
