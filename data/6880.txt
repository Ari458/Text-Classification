Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			Even as her aunt ignored complaints that her husband was frequently raping her, a 17-year-old girl got support from the uncle's parents to file a complaint with the police. The teenager claimed that her uncle had raped her many times over the last two months.

Acting on the minor's complaint, Nandanvan police have booked the accused, Naved Ali, 28, on rape charges. He has not been arrested yet.

A school dropout, the complainant told police in her statement that her mother had left her at her aunt's house at Nandanvan on February 21, and asked her to stay there for a few months. Two days later, Ali tried to molest the teenager while she was asleep. The girl told police that she woke up due to Ali's indecent acts and slapped him.

"She said that the disturbance had even woken up her aunt, but she turned a blind eye to the incident and went back to sleep. A few minutes later, Ali gagged and threatened her with dire consequences before forcing himself upon her," the police said.

The next morning, the minor spoke about the incident to her aunt but she ignored her complaint. The girl claimed that Ali would threaten and rape her every alternate day. Many times, she tried to convince her aunt to trust her, but she was repeatedly rebuffed.

In May, the minor had gone to Ali's house to meet his parents with the aunt. After a few meetings, the minor finally told about her suffering to Ali's parents, who encouraged her to file a police complaint.

It is learnt that Ali even threatened to kill the minor when she decided to report the matter to the police. After medical tests, the police have registered a case but are yet to arrest the accused. Cops said they are yet to question Ali's wife about the case.
