In a big embarrassment to Chandigarh police, a Class 10 girl lodged a complaint, alleging that she had been raped and molested by five constables for one and a half months.

In her complaint, the victim alleged that a few weeks ago, she had called police following a dispute with a relative. But the constable who had answered her call allegedly started harassing her on the pretext of recording her statement.

The constable in question also allegedly took her in a vehicle and raped her at gun point, four of the accused's colleagues joined him later and sexually exploited her for weeks.

Meanwhile, members of BJP and Congress staged a protest outside the Sector 17 police station, demanding dismissal of all the accused constables allegedly involved in the incident.

BJP activists also held a demonstration outside the Chandigarh Police Headquarters in Sector 9 and at some other prominent locations, including Sectors 22 and 16.

Police resorted to mild cane charge to disperse the protesters.

BJP Chandigarh unit President Sanjay Tandon said all the accused should be terminated from their job forthwith in order to send a clear message to police fraternity to not repeat such an act.
