Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			The Kashimira police at Mira Road is on the lookout for a man suspected to be a Bangladeshi national for allegedly raping a nine-year-old girl who used to live in his neighbourhood. The parents didn't wish to file a police case, which delayed registration of the FIR and helped the accused buy time to flee the locality.
According to the Kashimira police, the incident occurred around five days ago but the parents avoided registering a case, as they are both labourers and didn't want to waste their time in a long legal battle. But alert neighbours informed a local NGO who alerted the police and an FIR was registered on Sunday.
The victim's family hails from a small village in West Bengal and had migrated to Vinay Nagar slum at Vijaya Park area in Mira Road. The accused, their neighbour, had come to live next to them a year ago. On the day of the incident, the girl's father returned from work and didn't find her home. He then peeped into his neighbour's house and found him sexually abusing his daughter.
The victim's father got enraged and fought with his neighbour who managed to escape from the spot. The girl was found crying. The distraught parents didn't know what to do and kept quiet. But as neighbours inquired and learnt about the incident they alerted the local activists and finally the police was approached.
