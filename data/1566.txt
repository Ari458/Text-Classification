Description:
			Lakhi Hemrang(40) wife of Bhode Hemrang of the village Baghar Chuburi (12 KM from Kalaigaon) had been brutally be-headed at around 7-30 PM on March 28 in the name of "Witch Hunting".

According to information, five villagers armed with dao and khukri forcibly entered the house of the lady while her husband was away. They dragged her to a nearby field and be-headed her mercilessly. According to villagers, family conflict had been the cause of the brutal killing. An attempt was made six months ago too to kill her. A few villagers were responsible for spreading the rumour that she had been practising with craft in the village causing calamities to the villagers.
