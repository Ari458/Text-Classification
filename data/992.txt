Description:
			Fed up with the relentless torture meted out to her by her in-laws after she revealed that her husband was impotent, a 23-year-old Naina Pandav committed suicide by jumping in front of a local train in Malad (East) on Wednesday night.

The couple had married in February 2011. When she came to Mumbai to live with Ajay three months later, she realised that he was impotent. Ajay's (Husband) parents, however, asked us to send them the money for treatment, which I did," said Gandolia, victim's father.
