Rape
Description:
			When he took his ex-girlfriend on a long drive, Abhishek, 21, was not looking at any rapprochement. He was, in fact, out to wreak vengeance and got his friend, Thyagaraju, 21, to allegedly rape the 19-year-old in his car with its doors locked. Abhishek too sexually assaulted the girl.

The horrific incident took place on an empty stretch off Nice Road, on June 16. And to worsen matters, police are blaming the survivor, saying with her drinking and urban lifestyle, it was bound to happen.

Shreya (name changed), a BBM student with a city college, was raped in the car and later dumped near a park in the city. But that was only the beginning of Shreya's trauma. As she was drunk at the time of the incident and was with two boys in a car, police have been insensitive and disrespectful to her, she alleged.

According to her, investigating officers have been telling her that her lifestyle got her into trouble. "The cops kept asking me questions like for how long had I been drinking, and if my mother too drinks. This is irrelevant to the investigation," she said.

Her relationship with Abhishek began on Facebook. However, Abhishek sponged off Shreya and the relationship broke up. Shreya also knew Abhishek's friend Manjunath.

After the breakup, Sherya continued to be in touch with Manjunath and would check on Abhishek. But Manjunath allegedly told Abhishek that Shreya was getting close to him.

A furious Abhishek allegedly hatched a plan and called up Shreya on the pretext of mending their broken relationship. He asked her to join him on a road trip. Shreya, Abhishek and Thyagaraju started driving towards Talagattapura in a car.

The boys, both residents of Nandini Layout, got her drunk and parked the car near Channaveeranapalaya, off Nice Road. They took turns to rape her.

Abhishek was arrested from Madhugiri on July 3, while Thyagaraju was picked up from a bar in Vyalikaval.
