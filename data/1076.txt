Description:
			The couple had married in May 2005. Over the past six years, Laxman not only humiliated his wife because of her dark complexion, he forced her to abort, tried to kick her out of the house, continued ill-treating her after the birth of their child, and even secretly remarried.

In her complaint to the police, the woman had said that Shinde's dislike for her complexion didn't prevent him from having physical relations with her. And to ensure there were no dark babies, he made her consume abortion pills, she alleged.
