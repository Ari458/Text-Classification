Description:
			On December 5, the victim had visited the Abbas Building office for some work. She wanted to make some phone calls and learnt that there was no network in her mobile phone. She then came towards the staircase so that her mobile phone could get some range. Bawa was climbing up the stairs at that time. He then took advantage of the opportunity and forcibly kissed the victim after embracing her,” said an official from Colaba police station.
