Crime, Dowry Harassment
Description:
			A married woman committed suicide by hanging herself to a ceiling fan in her house at Velampeta over alleged dowry harassment by her husband.

Karanam Krishnaveni, 24, was found dead by the neighbours in the afternoon. Krishanveni hailing from Burada in Regidi mandal of Srikakulam, along with her welder husband Mallababu, hailing from Jangalapeta in Burja mandal of Srikakulam, were residing near the municipal stadium area for the past three months. According to Town police station inspector Illias Ahmad, Krishnaveni's parents gave Mallibabu Rs three lakh dowry at the time of the wedding but he allegedly kept harassing her for additional dowry. He had also quarreled with his wife and in-laws for not giving him money during Sankranti this year.

The night before the crime, the couple indulged in verbal duel and the next day, Krishnaveni took the extreme step after her husband went to work. After receiving a complaint from Krishnaveni's brother Surapa Naidu, the Town police registered a case under Section 304 (B) of IPC.
