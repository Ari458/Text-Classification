Street Harassment
Description:
			A 28-year-old Bandra resident was walking from Carter Road to her home in Sherly Rajan Road when a rickshaw approached her from behind. As she tried to get out of the way, one of the two men seated on the back seat groped her.Agitated, she began walking hurriedly towards her house. But before she could get to her house, which was about a few metres away, the autorickshaw returned.

This time, the 28-year-old fought back. "The road was deserted and they had stopped the rickshaw right next to me and one of them tried to molest me. I was terrified and could not think of anything so I asked him what he was up to and punched him on his face," the woman said.

But the attackers were not amused by her pluck. One of them started punching her."I punched him back. He tried to punch me again but I got out of the way and it hit my shoulder. I was screaming and I think the auto driver got a little scared and the trio left in the rickshaw," she said.

However, when she went to Khar police station and narrated the incident to the officers on duty, they refused to see it as a molestation case and sent her away after filing a mere non-cognisable complaint.
