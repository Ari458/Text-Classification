Rape, Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			An athlete, who has won medals in 100-metre and 200-metre events in the under-19 category at state level meets, has lodged a complaint against her coach, accusing him of raping her when the duo were on a holiday in Digha.

Both the athlete and her coach hail from Uttarpara, Hooghly. The coach, who lives in Makhla area, has been arrested and charged with rape.

In her complaint lodged at Uttarpara police station on Sunday night, the sprinter has said she and her coach had gone to Digha on a holiday for the weekend and returned on Sunday evening. She has alleged that her coach came to her room and raped her.

Asked why she had not lodged a complaint at Digha itself, she said, "I did not want to lodge the complaint at Digha police station as the place is unknown to me. For the same reason, I chose to keep quiet and not raise a voice in protest while at Digha. On returning home, I first told my family about the incident. My family members took me to Uttarpara police station to lodge a complaint."

On receiving the complaint late on Sunday evening,

Uttarpara police raided the coach's house around midnight and arrested him. "He has been arrested on the basis of specific evidence," said Uttarpara IC Arijit Dasgupta.
