Rape
Description:
			A Plus III student of Chandaka lodged a complaint against a youth of a neighbouring village, alleging that he raped her after offering lift in his truck on January 23. Based on her complaint, Chandaka police registered a rape case against the accused, Dilu Behera, 24, who is on the run.

While the complainant, who is admitted to Capital Hospital, and her parents refused to narrate the incident, police said the accused is an acquaintance of the girl.

She had gone to her uncle's house at Palaspur, about 10 km from her village and was waiting at the bus stand when Behera offered her lift. Since she knew him, she boarded the truck without suspecting his intention. He drove the truck to a solitary place and raped her.

The victim underwent medical examination. Police are trying to arrest the accused.

She approached police late as her family was earlier trying to convince the youth to marry her. The matter was brought before two village committees for a solution. After the fora failed to sort out the matter, the survivor lodged the FIR.
