Dowry Harassment
Description:
			A 29-year-old woman working as a software engineer with a US-based company at Gachibowli committed suicide due to dowry harassment, at her house in Nizampet on Tuesday night, the police said.

The woman, Shailaja, was married in 2011 to Naveen Kumar, who also works for a software company. The couple have an 11-month-old son. The couple used to stay at Prashanthnagar in Nizampet under Kukatpally Housing Board Police (KPHB) Station.

The womans parents told the police that at the time of marriage, they paid Rs. 20 lakh as dowry to Naveen Kumar. However, the latter began demanding more money and was harassing Shailaja for the last few months.

The previous evening, the woman went to her room along with the child to sleep and closed the door. On Wednesday morning, her husband, who was in the adjoining room, grew suspicious when the child started crying. He opened the door and found Shailaja hanging from a ventilator with the help of a saree, KPHB Sub Inspector K. Janaiah said.

The police registered a case and are investigating.
