			A 42-year-old woman was beaten to death allegedly by her husband's friend and his wife at a village in Chhattisgarh's Raipur district on suspicion that she practised 'witchcraft', police said on Sunday.

The accused, identified as Kalyan Tandon (50) and his wife Madhu (45), were arrested for allegedly killing Kamla Bai Sahu at Chandi village under Abhanpur police station limits last evening, SHO Abhanpur police station GC Pati told PTI.

"As per the statement of the accused, Kamla allegedly practised witchcraft due to which Madhu had a miscarriage three years ago," he said.

Preliminary investigation revealed that Kamla's husband Gorelal Sahu and Kalyan, both working as labourers, were good friends and their wives often visits each other houses.

While Kaylan was staying at Chandi, Gorelal was living in Abhanpur, he said.

When Kalyan's wife had a miscarriage three year ago, the couple thought that Kamla had played some 'black magic' due to which they lost their child before birth.
