Crime, Rape
Description:
			A man and his cousin were convicted and sentenced to prison terms today for raping, brutalising and attempting to murder his wife about a year ago.

The 25-year-old housewife was taken to a jungle at Murapara, about 65 km from here, on the night of February 23, last year by her husband Sankar Mandal (32) and his cousin Biswajit Bhowmik (33).

The cousin then raped her and both men brutalised her.

They then left her in the jungle presuming that she had died.

The woman, however, managed to reach a nearby human locality after a few hours and was hospitalised by the locals.

The Gomti district and sessions judge S K Pal awarded 12 years imprisonment to the cousin and five years jail term to her husband.
