Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A watchman was arrested by the Borivali police after he raped a five-year-old girl at the Borbhat Pada slums. The accused, Kailash Parmar (18), had fled from Borivali along with his partner after the incident. He was traced to Mulund by a team from the Borivali police station. 

The victim lives with her parents in the slum colony and Parmar was their neighbour. Between 8.30pm and 10pm, she was playing in the colony with other kids. Parmar landed up at the spot and sent the other kids away on the pretext of buying chocolates. He then sexually assaulted the victim. 

Later, some of the kids found the victim crying and informed their parents who in turn called the girl's mother. After the girl's mother approached the police, a case was registered under section 376 of IPC. The girl was rushed to the Shatabdi Hospital for a medical examination. 

Police formed a team to hunt for Parmar and quizzed his father. Parmar had turned 18 only earlier this month. He used to stay at Mulund before moving to Borivali. Police team tracked down his whereabouts to Mulund and took him into custody. He was produced before a magistrate court the same day. An Ahmedabad native, Parmar was living in with a Nepali national at Borivali.
