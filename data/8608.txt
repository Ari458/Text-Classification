Street Harassment
Description:
			Two minors paid a price for harassing women near a bus stop on Wednesday evening. Irate members of the public caught the duo, tied them to an electricity pole and thrashed them on Begur Main Road, Electronics City. They were later handed over to Hoysala policemen.

The boys are school dropouts and live near the Jnanappanahalli slum. They were rushed to Vaidehi Hospital for treatment before being taken to Electronics City police station. Later in the night, cops handed over the minors to their families after they gave an undertaking saying they will counsel their wards and ensure they don't repeat the offence.

"We received a call around 5pm about two boys passing lewd comments on women on Begur Main Road. Before we could reach the spot, members of the public had taken matters into their own hands," Hoysala police personnel said.

According to eyewitnesses, the two minors were standing near Canara Bank bus stop and were misbehaving with every woman passing by. "They were whistling, passing offensive comments and asking for their phone numbers. Meanwhile, it started raining and some women took shelter inside the bus stop," eyewitnesses said.

The boys followed them inside the shelter and continued to harass them till an elderly woman intervened. "The boys told her to mind her own business. This enraged some men at the bus stop, who attacked the boys," locals told police. The men beat up the boys, dragged them towards an electricity pole and tied them to it. Passersby took turns to hit them," police said.

Meanwhile, Hoysala personnel received the message and rushed to the spot. "We rescued the boys and shifted them to hospital. After handing them over to Electronics City police, we returned to the spot and requested more than 20 persons to file a complaint. But none obliged," said a Hoysala staffer, adding "Fortunately, the boys didn't sustain major injuries."
