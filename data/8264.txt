Rape
Description:
			A 21-year-old girl was allegedly raped by her husband and two of his friends on separate occasions at a hotel in central Delhi. Police have filed a rape case, but no arrests have been made so far. 

The matter came to the fore when the girl, a resident of Mumbai, approached Barakhamba Road police station last week. In her complaint, she told police that she had married a colleague after which they came for their honeymoon in Delhi.

“The girl has proof of their wedding ceremony. She, however, claims that the accused was delaying her request to get their marriage registered,” said a police officer.

The girl had been looking for a job in Mumbai last year. She and a female friend then went to Gujarat, where they got employed with an IT firm. She met the accused there.

After initial months of friendship, the accused told her that he wanted to marry her. They got married at a temple. Since then the girl had been asking her husband to get the marriage registered, but he made no efforts.  

“They came to Delhi and stayed at a hotel in central Delhi,” the officer added. The girl now claims that she was given drinks laced with sedatives when his friends came to meet them at the hotel.

She alleges that the two men also sexually assaulted her. A case of rape under Indian Penal Code has been registered with Barakhamba Road police station.

“We are verifying the complainant’s statement. No arrest has been made so far,” the officer added.

The girl’s medical examination was also conducted at Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, but it failed to establish sexual assault.

Sources said the investigating officers are also probing if the girl was raped and forced into prostitution after being brought to the capital.
