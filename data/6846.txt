Molestation
Description:
			A police constable has been arrested on Monday for allegedly molesting a middle-aged woman on Bhopal-Indore passenger train. The incident took place just after the train departed from Bairagarh railway station on Sunday late night. 

The 40-year-old victim, a resident of Veer Sawarkar Nagar in Indore, was travelling in S3 sleeper coach along with two other women, two kids and a youth. The family had only one reserved seat and requested travel ticket examiner (TTE) for more seats to accommodate all family members. 

When she couldn't get more seats, 32-year-old police constable Narayan Singh Thakur, who was seated on upper berth, offered to share seat with the woman. 

Just when she settled down on upper berth, Thakur, who is posted in radio wireless branch of Indore police, made sexual advances towards her allegedly under the influence of alcohol. 

Subsequently, the woman raised an alarm and the matter was reported to railway protection force ( RPF) squad in the train, which caught hold of the drunk cop. 

He was handed over to GRP personnel at Indore railway station on Monday morning. "We have booked the constable under Section 354A of IPC," investigating officer and GRP sub-inspector JP Dube told TOI. 

The arrested cop, however, refuted molestation charges levelled against him. "I was just trying to help the woman and her family members by allowing her to share my seat and didn't indulge in any objectionable act," said Thakur, who was to join 2016 Simhasta training duty in Ujjain from Monday.
