Domestic Violence, Crime, Dowry Harassment
Description:
			A 24-year-old woman's four fingers were chopped off when her husband, who had allegedly been demanding dowry, tried to stab her at her mother's residence in east Delhi's Mandawali area on Thursday.
The attack happened at around 1 pm when Sonam Verma, a mother of two-year-old, went to her mother's house. "Sachin Verma reached the house and after an altercation, he tried to stab her with a knife. The victim (Sonam) lost two fingers each of both hands when she tried to defend herself," a police officer said.

Sachin then pushed his mother-in-law, who raised an alarm, to the ground and fled, the officer said. Sonam also sustained stab injuries on her back in the attack and was rushed to a hospital where her condition is stated to be out of danger.
The victim's cousin brother Ashwini Bhardwaj also alleged that Sachin had been pressurising her for dowry, and attacked her over the issue.
"They had been regularly demanding dowry and victim's mother had been fulfilling those demands somehow. This time he asked for Rs 1.5 lakh to which she said that her mother was unable to arrange for the money," he said.
Following this, he had sent her to her mother's place. It was Sonam's birthday yesterday and Sachin today visited her on the pretext of giving her a gift. However, as soon as he reached home, he started quarreling over money and stabbed her, Bhardwaj alleged.
Police said they have lodged a case against Sachin and efforts are on to nab him.
Investigations are also on into allegations of dowry harassment, the officer said.
