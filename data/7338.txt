Rape
Description:
			A 25-year-old Kolkata woman, who had gone to Delhi to look for jobs, was allegedly gang-raped by four Facebook friends in Ramnagar, Nainital. 

The four accused are Delhiites Chhavi Rajput, Ashish Singh, Aditya Jaiswal and Siddharth Beniwal. The woman is from central Kolkata and had befriended the four on her job hunt. 

Ramnagar senior SI Mohan Pandey told TOI that according to the complaint the four had taken her CV and promised to get her a job. "They told her about a plan to visit Ramnagar and asked her to come along with them. The victim agreed. She was gang-raped on June 30 in Ramnagar," Pandey said. 

After returning to Delhi, she registered a case against the four at Bindapur police station on July 2. A case was registered under IPC sections 354 (assault or criminal force to outrage a woman's modesty) and 376D (gang-rape). After the initial probe, the case was transferred to Ramnagar police station on Wednesday. 

Ramnagar SI Sweta Negi is the investigating officer. "Since several matters related to the crime are still unclear, the IO is going to New Delhi to collect details of the incident," Pandey said. 

This comes nine months after the gruesome gang rape and murder of Nadia girl Moumita Das in Dehradun's Chakrata. Her fiance, Dum Dum boy Avijit Paul, was also murdered.
