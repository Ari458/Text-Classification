Foeticide/Infanticide
Description:
			Professor of Social Work Rita Noronha said that the child sex ratio in Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts has been declining steadily over the last decade. The ideal girl-boy ratio accepted internationally was 1,050:1,000. Considering the total number of boys born, she estimated that a total of 10,000 fewer girls were born than boys.

Ms. Noronha said that a number of factors including female foeticide and preference for a male child were responsible for the declining number. Another factor was the increasing preference for only one child.
