Description:
			A small-time model-turned-actor was arrested on Friday by the Malad police for allegedly sending lewd messages to a 42-year-old woman from Malad (West) and also stalking her. The accused was arrested two months after the complainant registered an FIR.
 
The Malad police said the complainant approached them in April to complain against model Karan Kapoor. She said she met him four years back through a common friend.
 
However, over time, Kapoor allegedly started behaving in an overly friendly manner with her and started sending lewd messages. She also told the police that later he started stalking her.
 
Senior inspector Arun Mane said, "Kapoor has been booked under the new amended law for sexual harassment under section 354 and 354 (b) of the IPC and under relevant sections of the IT Act."
