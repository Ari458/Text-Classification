Rape
Description:
			An 18-year-old girl was allegedly sexually assaulted by her cousin at a deserted house in Lingarajapuram in Banaswadi police limits. The incident came to light after the victim made a complaint to the police.

The victim, a manual labourer, lived with her elder sister, as she had lost her parents at a young age. The suspect, Roopesh Kumar (22), a fruit vendor, lived in the same neighbourhood. Roopesh had asked his cousin, who was on her way to work, to go with him to a friend’s house and she accompanied him.

But he took her to a deserted house where he sexually assaulted her. She later narrated the incident to her sister and the family tried to settle the matter internally. However, the victim and her sister filed a complaint against Roopesh with the Banaswadi police. She was also subjected to a medical examination.

Roopesh proposed to marry the victim two or three times in the past, but the girl rejected it as they were cousins.
