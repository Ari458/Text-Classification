Child Sexual Abuse, Murder, Rape
Description:
			Three people, including the headmaster of Arvind Ashram School in Dadhade in the district, have been booked in connection with the death of a 12-year-old girl last month.

The victim Akshata Kavte was a student of standard VI and a resident of Ghol village in Thane's Dahanu taluka.

The ashram school is located in Dadhade village of Vikramgadh taluka of the district. Ashram schools are residential for tribal children.

On November 24, she was taken to a village hospital by the school authorities who said she was suffering from jaundice. However, the girl was declared brought dead by the doctors at the hospital.

The police then registered a case of accidental death and launched a probe into it.

However, the girl's parents suspected a foul play. The deceased's father had told reporters that he had observed a deep wound on her leg and her clothes were also torn, leading him to suspect that she was subjected to sexual harassment.

On December 23, activists of Adivasi Ekta Parishad took out a protest morcha to the local Tehasil office demanding action against the school management, following which cases were registered against Head Master Harishchandra Bhoye, Superintendent Ranjana Nagade and cook Bandu Raut under section 304 (A) (causing death by negligence).
