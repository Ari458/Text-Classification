Abuse
Description:
			A Howrah teenager, apparently spurned in love, attacked a 16-year-old girl and her family at their Naba Kumar Nandi Lane home and left four injured, two among them seriously, on Wednesday evening. The family was targeted for daring to lodge a complaint against him.

Police late at night picked up the accused and slapped him with non-bailable charges. The teenager's cohorts, however, are still absconding.

The police action was triggered after angry locals hit the streets in protest demanding action. Cops, however, defended their action saying the complaint was lodged at 4:30pm and the attack took place even before they could start an enquiry. They, however, remained evasive on why they chose to act on a cognizable crime so late.

Around 3pm, the girl had stepped out of home to fetch drinking water. Her aunt was with her. It was then Ritwik Paswan, 19, stopped his motorcycle, emptied a liquor bottle on her and threatened set her aflame. When her aunt rushed to her rescue, Ritwik assaulted them and fled.

An hour later, the girl went to the police station to lodge an FIR against Ritwik. She told cops that Ritwik had been professing his love to her but she turned him down due to his criminal antecedents.

Once back home, they faced the worst. Ritwik and his gang forced into their house, armed with revolver and a sword. When the girl's brother tried to intervene, he was hit with a revolver butt. When the girl's mother stepped in, someone slashed at her hand. Others who tried to save them were met with similar attacks. As locals started gathering, Ritwik and his gang fled.

Soon after the incident the locals hit the streets in protest. It was only then police intervened and picked up Ritwik from an "undisclosed hideout. Howrah OC Tathagata Pandey said, "More arrests are likely, raids will continue overnight."
