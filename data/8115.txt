Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A 30-year-old housewife and three others were arrested in connection with forcing her 13-year-old step-daughter subject to sexual assault by their relatives in their residence, near Bovikkanam, under the Adhur police station limits.

Shahida, second wife of Abdul Gafoor, her relative Ajmal, and two minor youths were arrested under provisions of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012, for facilitating and committing sexual harassment on the minor girl, A. Satheesh Kumar, Adhur circle inspector, said here on Thursday.

Shahida and Ajmal, who were produced before the Additional District Sessions Court (1) exclusively trying sexual offence cases, were remanded to judicial custody till December 14, while the other accused minors were sent to a juvenile home, he said.

Shahida was charged with forcing her step-daughter to watch pornographic clippings in cell phones to lure the girl and have sex with her relatives while the girl's two younger sisters were said to have been harassed inside their house over the last three months. A medical examination carried out on the minor girl established sexual assault on her.

Gafoor had sent his first wife back to her own home after she fell sick due to diabetes and driven their children to stay with his second wife at Povvel, near here.

The shocking incident came to light after the minor girl drew the attention of her school teachers who in turn took up the matter with the Childline authorities, the police said.
