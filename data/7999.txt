Abduction
Description:
			Three days after an auto-rickshaw driver kidnapped and sexually harassed a third year engineering student in a posh city area, the driver surrendered in court on Sunday evening. Later, police took him on a remand. 

Additional superintendent of police Rajesh Singh Bhadoria said accused appear to be a habitual offender and police are trying to verify his antecedents. Cops raided over 17 places to nab him during the last two days. 

Accused, Sharif Khan, 45, changed registration number of auto-rickshaw and tampered its engine and chassis number so that it could not be identified. Auto-rickshaw is of 2000 model and has been sold and resold around 11 times. 

But its record of owner was not available after 2004 due to which it was tough for cops to chase its owner. Accused purchased the auto-rickshaw few months ago. 

Accused had gone to Chhindwara after committing the crime, but when cops started rounding up his relatives, he along with his brother-in-law reached court in a dramatic way with covered face and surrendered. 

Sharif stays in Phoota Makbara and Barkheda area of city and reportedly has two wives. Police believed his motive behind kidnapping bid was to rape the engineering student. 

Student, a native of Timakgarh, was talking on her mobile phone at Shakti Nagar when the auto driver threw a blanket on her and forced her onto the front seat of the auto, police said. 

He abducted the girl and moved some distance, but the girl raised an alarm and jumped from the auto on which passersby turned up on which accused fled leaving the vehicle. People called up police. A case was registered at Govindpura police station of the city. 

It came to light that he is a criminal under surveillance of Risen district.
