Description:
			The body of a one-year-old baby, who was kidnapped by a miscreant 25 days ago from Kukudakhandi, has been found dead.

It was found in a box near a bush in the MKCG Medical College and Hospital campus here yesterday, the police said.

The accused, identified as Sridhar Mohapatra alias Tiria, was arrested from his house at Nayagarh by tracking his cellphone.

The body was recovered after the accused identified the location, the police said.

The accused killed the baby two days after the kidnapping as he did not eat anything and was taken ill, the police said.

The accused had entered Patra's house to loot on June 24. When he did not find anything, he kidnapped the baby to extract money.

Even after killing the baby, the kidnapper had demanded a ransom of Rs. 6 lakh, the police said.
