Abduction, Rape
Description:
			A 19-year-old Dalit girl was kidnapped and gang-raped by two men at Kaithal district in the state.

The crime took place within hours after Sonia Gandhi's visit to Jind district to meet the family of a rape victim, who couldn’t bear the trauma and committed suicide.

Offering condolences to the Dalit family at their village home in Jind district, Gandhi said, I strongly condemn such barbaric incidents of crime against women. The perpetrators of such acts should be given the severest punishment.

She also took on the khap panchayats, which had suggested lowering the marriage age to serve as a deterrent to such crimes. We have a democratic set-up and law is in the hands of the judiciary, not anyone else,she said.

However, defending the Congress-ruled state, Gandhi said Rape cases aren't (happening) in Haryana alone but are being reported from across the country and need to be curbed.

On October 6, the minor was allegedly raped by two men while a female accomplice kept watch. Later in the day, she set herself afire. Police have arrested five persons, including the woman and her policeman husband.

There were 12 rapes in the state in September, according to media reports, including one in which a victim's father killed himself.
