Abuse
Description:
			Two men allegedly kicked and punched a woman restaurateur in the upscale Koregaon Park area when her staff refused to serve them alcohol after closing hours on Friday. The duo was arrested on charges of outraging a woman's modesty, voluntarily causing hurt and intentional insult. They were produced before a city court which granted them bail.

The police said the two men, Kevin Anthony (33) and Monty alias Venalicius D'Souza (34), are residents of Salunkhe Vihar road in the Kondhwa area.

The 31-year-old woman, who is the co-owner of the restaurant, told TOI that the duo was accompanied by two other men and a woman. "The group had ordered for food and alcohol. However, during their meal, the men began abusing the waiters saying they had been served cold food. The waiters apologised, but the group was in no mood to listen. They demanded that they meet the owner of the restaurant and lodge a complaint," she said.
