Description:
			Five persons, including an SI held so far; more arrests likely

The district women police have arrested a Dravida Munentra Kazhagam functionary in the case pertaining to rape of a minor girl.

After arresting five persons, including a Sub Inspector of Police and a conductor of the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation in the last two days, the women police have arrested Muthurak alias Gundu Kannan (46), treasurer of DMK Sivaganga town unit.

Police sources said he was arrested on Thursday and remanded in judicial custody. He was a money lender and had established contact with the victim through a woman, the sources said. He hailed from Vairavanpatti, near Manamadurai, the native village of the victim’s father, the sources added.

More arrests are on the anvil and the girl, pursuing higher studies in a college in Chennai , is being brought here for identifying the accused, the sources said. “As there is more than one person in the same name in her statement made under Section 164 of the Cr. P.C., identification of the accused is mandatory,” the sources told The Hindu .

She had named two male doctors in the statement but inquiries revealed that they performed abortion. She has been subjected to physical abuse for three years since she entered class X and underwent abortion twice, the sources said. She has also named a 35-year-old advocate, the sources added.

The girl’s grandfather also figured in the list of those abused her, the sources said. She, however, said in the statement that the grandfather died, but police investigation revealed that her maternal and paternal grandfathers were alive. The girl’s aunt who was taking care of her since her childhood pretended to be ‘innocent,’ was found guilty of pushing her into prostitution, the sources said.
