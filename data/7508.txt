Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			Just four months after a rape accused was lynched in full public view in Dimapur, a mob killed a 35-year-old man, Hussain Ali, for allegedly raping a minor girl.

In a statement, Dimapur Police said Ali died of 'suspected internal injuries' after being 'manhandled' by a mob at Khekiho village under Dhansiripar outpost of Dimapur district on Tuesday.

Two persons Abdul Shaid and Hatim Mia were arrested in connection with the incident. Police said more arrests were likely.

The minor girl, a non-local, went missing from Kheikiho on July 7. She was found confined in a house in Lhotavi village. Police said the girl was raped by Ali. The news of the alleged rape angered villagers and they 'manhandled' Hussain. Village elders extricated Hussain and were taking him to Dhansiripar police outpost when he succumbed to his injuries.

Police said Ali's body bore bruises on the limbs and back. Two separate cases of rape and murder were registered.

On March 5, a mob broke into Dimapur Central Jail, dragged out a rape accused, stripped him naked, paraded him naked for a few kilometers and lynched him.
