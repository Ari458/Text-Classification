Domestic Violence, Murder, Dowry Harassment
Description:
			A local court sentenced a man to 10 years rigorous imprisonment for murdering his wife demanding more dowry about three years ago.

Additional District and Session judge Rohitlal Panda yesterday awarded the jail term to 31-year-old Avimanyu Dalei of Hatibari village and also slapped him a fine of Rs 10,000 for setting his wife on fire demanding more dowry and killing her in February 2012.

Dalei had married in 2010 and had been given cash, gold ornaments and household articles as per his family's demand. However, soon after his marriage he began torturing his 22-year-old wife demanding a motor cycle as dowry, according to the prosecution.

He sent his wife to her parents' place in 2012, a month before killing her, to get the motorcycle for him. But she had returned empty handed as her parents expressed their inability to give more dowry.

Avimanyu then set her on fire after pouring kerosene on her while she was preparing food in the kitchen on February 8, 2012. She suffered severe burns and hearing her screams, the neighbours rescued and took her to a nearby hospital. She succumbed on her way to the hospital.
