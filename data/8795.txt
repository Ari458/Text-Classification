			Two youths have been arrested for reportedly sexually assaulting an eight-year-old girl in Vedanatham village near Tiruvannamalai.

According to police, S Prathap, 25, of Vedanatham Colony in Keel Pennathur, and his cousin R Murugan, 30, of the same colony were arrested on Wednesday for sexually assaulting the girl.

The duo took the girl to a sugarcane farm when she was returning from school on November 15 and sexually assaulted her. They threatened the girl that they would throw her into a well if she disclosed to the incident to her family members and others.

On Tuesday, Prathap went to meet the girl's father. On seeing him, the girl frightened and ran into the house. Sensing something wrong, the girl's mother asked her daughter what happened. The girl told her mother about the incident.

Inspector of AWPS Latha, after conducting an inquiry, registered a case against the duo under sections 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) and 506 (I) (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the IPC read with sections 6 (punishment for aggravated penetrative sexual assault) and 10 of POSCO Act and section 4 of Tamil Nadu Prohibition of Harassment of Women Act 1998.

The police took the victim to a hospital for medicinal examination.
