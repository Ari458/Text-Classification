The victim is a medico from Karnataka and had checked into the private guest house on Road Number 45 of Jubilee Hills on June 1 to appear for the PG medical exams in UK-based institutions. 

While the victim was sleeping in her room, Bikki entered the room by unlocking the door on Saturday morning. "The door lock opens if one turns the knob hard. Bikki knew it and after the victim fell asleep, he sneaked into the room and tried to force himself on her," DCP, West Zone, V Satyanarayana said.
