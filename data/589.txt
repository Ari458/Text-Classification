Description:
			A 28-year-old woman, Ajmera Bibi in an advanced stage of pregnancy, was burnt to death by her in-laws in front of her nine-year-old son. L

"The boy watched as his mother was first kicked repeatedly in the abdomen. Ajmera screamed and pleaded with them to spare her unborn child but her in-laws refused to relent. The woman was then throttled till she collapsed. The in-laws then dragged her into the bathroom. When the boy tried to resist, his grandfather told him that they would burn him along with his mother unless he stopped 'bothering them'. Sohail was then pushed into a room while kerosene was poured on his mother and a match was lit. The boy was traumatised and broke down several times while narrating the incident to us," a police officer said.
