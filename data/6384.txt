Murder
Description:
			In a suspected case of honour killing, an 18-year-old girl was killed by her brother for having a relationship with her neighbour at the Kankerkheda police station area here, police said today.

Amit was arrested today for killing his sister Bharti, a class 11th student by slitting her throat as he was unhappy over her relationship with their neighbour, SP (City) Om Prakash said.

The accused was arrested along with the weapon used in the crime after a complaint was filed by Babulal, father of the victim today, he said.

The incident took place last night under Kankerkheda police station area when the victim went with her neighbour Rahul when her family was asleep, police said, adding that Bharti was dragged inside the house by the accused when she returned and later slit her throat in front of their parents.

The accused then started a manhunt for the neighbour and attacked Rahul's cousin brother Mohit during his search, Prakash said.

Mohit has been admitted to a hospital, he added.

During the interrogation, Amit confessed to the crime but said that he had no regrets over his action as his sister's relationship had "defamed the honour" of the family, police said, adding he has been sent to 14-days judicial custody.

The body of the victim has been sent for post mortem and further investigation is on in the matter, they said.
