Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			A Rajasthan government official has been arrested for allegedly demanding sexual favour from an executive of a private company in return of selecting her firm for installing solar lights at a state-owned building.

Ramesh Sankhla, an official of Rajasthan Account Services, was arrested on the complaint of the victim.

Sankhla is currently posted as GM (Finance) with the Rajasthan State Road Transport Corporation and also deals with the tendering process for installation of solar lights at a government building.

According to the complaint, Sankhla took the victim to his house on the pretext of getting some documents related to their business deal.

The victim had stayed outside the house but Sankhla called her inside and tried to show her an obscene film on TV.

Sankhla then demanded sexual favour from her in return of selecting her firm for the installation of solar lights.

Shocked by the proposal, the woman telephoned her colleagues and called them at the spot, who after beating him up handed him over to the police. Sankhla was under the influence of alcohol.
