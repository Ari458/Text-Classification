Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			Yet another case of sexual abuse has emerged from a state-run shelter in Shirur taluka. The Pune rural police recently arrested a 52-year-old junior clerk of a shelter home for girls and his 20-year-old son for allegedly raping two minor girls.

The Shirur police said that the suspects Shabbir Bale and his son Bablu Bale were produced before court and were remanded in police custody till July 25. The duo have been charged under section 376 (rape), 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act.

Bhagwan Nimbalkar, inspector of the Shirur police station said the assault happened between November 2013 and June 2014 on the premises of the shelter home. "The rape survivors are two orphans 14 and 15 years old, who were living in the shelter," Nimbalkar said.

He said that the suspects had threatened the girls that they would kill them if they disclosed anything about the sexual assault to anyone. "In June this year, the girls were transferred to another shelter home in the district. The assault came to light when they revealed the entire episode to the counsellors there," Nimbalkar said.

The authorities at the shelter home then approached the district women and child development department. The department lodged a police complaint. "We are investigating whether the suspects had similarly assaulted any other girls in the shelter home," Nimbalkar said.

The police said that Bale lives near the shelter home along with his family. His son Bablu is pursuing BA from a private college.
