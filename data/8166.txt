Dowry Harassment
Description:
			A case has been registered against Nizamabad sub-inspector for allegedly assaulting his wife over dowry demands on Wednesday.

The case of dowry harassment came to light when the 19 year old victim, Athika Salwa Samad, moved the State Minorities Commission last week seeking intervention in the matter. Nizamabad SP S Chandra sekhar Reddy said, the case against Pasha has been registered at Women's' Police here. "Cases against 11 people have been filed regarding dowry harassment. The SI is now working in Medak and we will send letters to the SP concerned," he said. The accused has not been charge-sheeted thus far, he clarified. "He will be charge-sheeted soon," he said.

Victim's father M A Samad said that Mohammed Muqeed Pasha, SI at District Crime Records Bureau, Nizamabad, had married Athika on October 9. While the parents conceded to his and his family's dowry demands of Rs 5 lakh, 16 tolas of gold, a Pulsar motorcycle, these did not stop. Soon after the wedding, the cop's father, Mohd Maulana, along with other family members demanded a car and independent house. In her petition, the victim said how Pasha's parents later demanded a car, 25 tolas of gold and 50 tolas silver. Her father had to sell away a plot of land so as to buy a car, Athika said.
