Abuse
Description:
			Four youths threw acid on a 16-year-old girl in Hanumangarh's Talwara town after she resisted their attempt to gang-rape her. The girl was admitted at a hospital in Hanumangarh and is undergoing treatment for burns on her face and other body parts.

The four youths had sneaked into her house after midnight on Friday and tried to kidnap her when their attempts to gang-rape her at her house failed. The family members made a shocking allegation, saying they had complained about constant harassment of the girl by the same gang of youths in the past, but the police didn't take any action. It emboldened the accused. 

The police failed to nab the four youths even after the acid attack. They said that the accused are on the run and a search has been launched for them.

The girl was staying with her maternal grandmother in Talwara's Ward Number 1. The girl and the grandmother were fast asleep when four youths, identified by the victim as Deepu alias Deepak Sikaligar, Jonny, Suraj and one more man, jumped over the boundary wall and sneaked into the house.

"As per the girl, the four were trying to gang rape her. She resisted, so they dragged her out of the house and took her to a car parked in the street outside. They forced her to keep mum by threatening that they would throw acid on her if she made noise," said a police officer.

However, she kept resisting. Irked over this, the youths acted on their threat and poured acid on her and sped away in their car.

On hearing cries for help, the grandmother and some neighbours rushed to her rescue. They took her to a hospital. "We have recorded the girl's statement and registered an FIR against the four youths. They are on the run," said the officer.
