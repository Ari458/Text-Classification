Rape
Description:
			A sub-inspector attached to the Cubbon Park traffic police is absconding after being accused of raping a Delhi-based woman. The woman has, in her complaint to Delhi police, said the officer was posted at the Indiranagar police station when he raped her.

Delhi police have come to Bangalore twice already but Dhananjaya was not available for questioning. Police sources said knowing well that he was in trouble, he may have gone on unauthorized leave.

Additional commissioner of police (law and order) Kamal Pant said Delhi police had approached the Cubbon Park traffic police station directly and there was no communication between the city police higher-ups and Delhi police. "We heard that sub-inspector Dhananjaya is facing a rape and cheating case for hiding his marriage with the complainant with whom he had a relationship," he said.

DCP (traffic-west) S Girish said Dhananjaya was transferred from Indiranagar police station to Cubbon Park traffic police station on June 24, but has not reported for duty.

The woman filed a case with Malaviya Nagar police in New Delhi.

Police commissioner Raghavendra H Auradkar, however, said he knew that Delhi police had come to question the sub-inspector and but didn't know if it was a rape case.

"He is a married man and had a relationship with the Delhi-based woman, who in her complaint stated that the sub-inspector hid the fact that he was married while she was staying in Indiranagar. The duo had gone on a trip to Nandi Hills last March," a source in city police said.
