			A 22-year-old man was arrested for repeatedly raping a minor girl after kidnapping her from her house in New Delhi, police said on Monday.

Parwaiz, a resident of east Delhi's Jafrabad, was arrested on Saturday from his house after the 15-year-old victim's family registered a complaint that the girl was missing.
