Rape
Description:
			In January 2011, Anuradha Dhumal invited her  neighbour to the Bharat Wayda's home in Vire village at Vangaon in Dahanu. They offered her tea laced with sedatives, said the police, adding that after the victim fell unconscious, Wayda raped her while Dhumal filmed the act on a mobile. Wayda later blackmailed the victim with the clipping and raped her on several occasions. The woman bore the torture as the accused had threatened to circulate the images, the police said. In January this year, Wayda allegedly sent the video to his friends as well as the victim's husband. When the victim's husband asked Wayda to delete the clips, he allegedly demanded Rs 5 lakh.
