Molestation
Description:
			A 23-year-old girl had a harrowing experience on Tuesday night when an auto driver and his associate allegedly tried to molest her on Nandidurga Road.

Coincidentally, the city police launched Crime Prevention month on Wednesday with the focus on curbing crime against women and children.

The victim works in a readymade garment showroom on Commercial Street.

She was on her way home from work when the alleged incident occurred around 11.30 p.m. The police said that she walked with her friend till Cauvery Junction and, after her friend left, waited for an auto.

When she hailed an autorickshaw, she noticed a man sitting in the back seat. A police office said, The driver convinced the woman that it was his friend who would get on the front seat after passing Cantonment Railway Station where police usually check vehicles."

Heeding his request, the woman got into the autorickshaw. However, just when the auto was nearing her house, the man sitting next to her began to misbehave and touched her inappropriately.

The victim screamed. Two bikers, who were passing by, questioned the auto driver. Seizing the opportunity, the woman jumped out of the autorickshaw, ran to her house and locked the door.

Sensing trouble, the auto driver and his friend sped away. The woman, who lives with her mother and a cousin, later filed a complaint at the jurisdictional Cubbon Park police station.

The police have taken up a case under Section 354 (outraging modesty) and are trying to track down the two men. There are no clues about them but we are examining available CCTV footage, a senior police officer said.
