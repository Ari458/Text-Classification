Abuse
Description:
			Two policemen a special sub inspector and a constable were dismissed from service on Sunday after a departmental enquiry established that they misbehaved and harassed women staff of an old-age home in Virugambakkam two years ago. While the cops have been dismissed from service, no legal action has been initiated against them so far, police said.

SSI Kumaresan and constable Raja, then attached to the law and order wing of the station, were suspended in July 2014 after complaints were made by the old-age home workers to the then city police commissioner S George.

A departmental enquiry that followed found them guilty after which they were dismissed from service on the orders of the Commissioner.  The cop-duo, in an inebriated state, had raided the old age home, 'Miracle' in Virugambakkam stating that they had information that a prostitution racket was being run from there. The policemen also outraged the modesty of two women nurses and attempted to molest them. Subsequently, the home-in charge filed a complaint against them.
