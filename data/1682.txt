Description:
			A 16-year-old girl was abducted from her house in village Sikanderpur (Badha), near sector 84 here in Gurgoan on Tuesday midnight. She was on a visit to her elder sister's in-laws house.

Rupesh, 26, a resident of Sikanderpur was known to the victim's brother-in-law who also resides in the same village. The accused and a relative of victim Pappu were partners in a cab transport business.

The victim told police that the accused came at midnight on Tuesday and told her that her relative was injured in a road accident and they had to visit the hospital. She was then taken to an isolated house and gang raped by six youths.

When Pappu returned in the early hours on Wednesday, he realised something was amiss and with the help of family members they rescued the girl from the spot.
