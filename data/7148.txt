Child Sexual Abuse, Murder, Rape
Description:
			A 12-year-old girl was found murdered at her house in North-East Delhi New Usmanpur on Tuesday.

The police suspect she was raped or gang-raped before being strangled. The victim's mother found the body lying semi-nude on the floor.

A confirmation on sexual assault will be made only after we receive the post-mortem report, said a police officer.

Sources said three persons, including the familys landlord and his son, have been detained. They were held after some neighbours told the police they had seen bloodstains on the landlords clothes.

The Class VI student lived with her mother, who is a widow and works as domestic help in Central Delhi Daryaganj.

The mother returned home around 8 p.m. on Tuesday and found the main door locked from outside. She went inside from another door that opens into another tenants room, who is out of Delhi for the past few days.

The mother raised an alarm and the neighbours rushed the girl to a hospital, where she was declared brought dead. The hospital informed the police, the officer added.

Sources said there were several injury marks on her private parts, thighs and chest. Three teams have been constituted to solve the case.
