Description:
			A teacher was arrested for allegedly raping a female student repeatedly in the past two years in the outskirts of Jammu city, police said.

Bodh Raj of RS Pura was arrested yesterday after the victim's mother lodged a complaint two days ago alleging that her daughter was being sexually assaulted by her teacher in the private tuition where she was admitted in 2014.        

"The accused started sexually assaulting the girl soon after she was admitted in his tuition two years ago and her ordeal continued as he had threatened her against opening her mouth," a police officer privy to the investigations said.      

The girl finally gathered courage and narrated her experience to her mother who reported the matter to the police, he said.  

A medical examination of the girl was conducted which confirmed the rape following which a case was registered and the accused was arrested, the officer said.

He said the investigations in the case showed the teacher, was in an extra-marital affair with a woman in 1999.

"The woman along with Bodh Raj killed her husband in August 1999, following which they were sentenced to ten years imprisonment," he said.           

After their release from the jail, both of them started living as a couple and in 2012 the woman also died under suspicious circumstances, the officer said, adding, Bodh Raj shifted to RS Pura and started a tuition center after the death of his partner.       

Police suspect that the accused might have sexually exploited other female students as well.

"We are investigating the case and it might be possible that because of intimidation or other reasons, other female students might not have opened their mouth," he said.
