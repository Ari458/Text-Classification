Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A 15-year-old girl from Bangladesh was allegedly gang-raped near the India-Bangladesh border at Basirhat's Swarupnagar area in North 24-Parganas. Police said the culprits had already been identified and raids were on to nab them. However, no one was arrested till the last report came in.

Two years back, the girl had come to her elder sister's house at Basirhat's Matia area. On Saturday night, she was returning back with her sister and few other relatives in a car. After reaching the border area, the car had stopped as it could not go further for security reasons.

Suddenly, five youths came at the spot in a car and dragged the girl out of the car. Her relatives tried to resist but failed to stop the goons. The attackers shoved the girl into their car and drove away.

They took her to an abandoned house nearby, gang-raped her and dumped her at the place. She was later rescued by the locals, who then admitted her to the Basirhat sub-divisional hospital. A complaint was later lodged at the Swarupnagar police station.
