Foeticide/Infanticide
Description:
			Two days after the Panchkula health department team and Chandigarh police jointly raided a private clinic where two quacks conducted illegal abortions, two main accused was arrested.

Police said the accused, Vijay Pandey and Lalit Kumar, who fled on Sunday evening, conducted abortions despite the fact that they had not even cleared Class X.

They were booked under the MTP (Medical Termination of Pregnancy) and PNDT (Pre-Conception And Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques) Act and will be produced at a local court in Chandigarh on Wednesday. Inspector Baldev Kumar, SHO, Mauli Jagran police station, said, "Both were arrested from Manimajra. They are not qualified doctors. We will produce them in the local court on Wednesday."

A team of the Panchkula health, woman and child development department and Mahila police station (MPS) planned to nab the accused after receiving a complaint on June 1.

A decoy customer was sent with a woman constable to meet the accused, who took them to Vikas Colony in Mauli Jagran. When the clinic was raided, the two main accused, who claimed to be doctors, fled while two helpers, Diya and Komal, were arrested.
