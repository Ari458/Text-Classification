Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			West Bengal has witnessed several gruesome sex crimes over the past one year, but the latest one, in which a 10-year-old boy allegedly raped a three-year-old girl, is the most shocking.
 
The boy was taken into custody after he raped the girl on Thursday evening in Ausgram in Burdwan district, about 130 km to the north west of Kolkata.

According to the girl's family, members, she complained of pain in her anus while she was being cradled to sleep by her aunt on Thursday evening. The aunt got suspicious and questioned the girl, who told her about the boy's act.
 
Police sources told HT that a preliminary medical test has been conducted on the victim.

Since the boy is a minor, he was sent to a juvenile home by the Child Welfare Committee. Only a Juvenile Justice Board can take up his case.
