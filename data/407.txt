Dowry Harassment
Description:
			A city-based doctor told the police that her husband had pushed her from the terrace after forcing her to write a suicide note. 
"She told us that her in-laws and husband forced her to write a suicide note and later pushed her from the terrace. The accused have, however, been absconding since the incident," said a police officer at Mahesh Nagar police station.

She was admitted at a private hospital by her in-laws on Monday morning. It had been less than five months that the victim was married to Jayesh, 28, a second-year student of post graduation at Lala Lajpat Rai Medical College, Meerut. It was a grand marriage ceremony that now regrets the father of the girl. "We had gone beyond our limits to arrange a car and considerable amount of gold. It, however, only further inflamed the greed of her in-laws," said Swati's father, Ramesh Sharma.

After being denied the money, her in-laws threatened to expel her from the house and Jayesh was called from Meerut on Sunday.
