Description:
			A 24-year-old man has been arrested for chopping off his sister-in-laws nose at her house in outer Delhis Mangolpuri in October. 

The accused had gone to the house wearing only his underwear and tried to strangle her. Her three-year-old son, who was in the room, had escaped unhurt, police said on Wednesday.

The man wanted to disfigure his sister-in-law after she repeatedly rejected his advances. She underwent a reconstruction surgery last month because of which her nose is in a better shape now, said a police officer. Despite the assault on October 12, police learnt of his role only last week. 

The woman had hidden his involvement in her initial statement,the officer added.

The 22-year-old woman had blamed an unknown person for the assault. The investigating officer said she was scared for the family's reputation because of which she had protected the accused.
Her statement was again recorded last week in which she mustered the courage to reveal his identity. The accused was subsequently arrested from his house on Monday. 

Since the woman kept warding him off, he wanted revenge through disfiguring her face, the officer said.

The woman lives with her husband and son on the third floor of a house in Mangolpuri. 

Her husband works as a driver and had left home for his night shift late that day.

The woman told police that she was sleeping with her son when the man managed to enter her room at around 11.30 pm. He attacked without warning her. The man cut off her nose and threw it on the floor. He then tried to strangle her with a rope, the officer added.

The woman was taken to Sanjay Gandhi Memorial Hospital with the mutilated part of the nose. However, it was too late for reconstructive surgery. Last month, she underwent surgery at Safdarjung Hospital. 

A case of attempt to murder has been filed with Mangolpuri police station.
