Assistant sub-inspector Gurbhej Singh, in-charge of Mahala police post, on Wednesday said that police had registered a case against professor Sajid Hussain, from department of microbiology, under Section 354 (outraging the modesty of a woman) of the IPC.

According to the officer, two first semester girl students of GNDU had given a complaint of molestation and making advances for physical relations against the professor.
