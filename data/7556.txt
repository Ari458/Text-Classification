Murder, Street Harassment
Description:
			A 22-year-old jilted lover, who allegedly stabbed two sisters to death at their house in Gayathri Nagar area here on July 14, was on Tuesday arrested by the police.

Amit Singh, whose family hails from Mathura in Uttar Pradesh, is accused of murdering Yamini Saraswathi (23) and her sister Srilekha (21) at their house.

According to police, Amit and Srilekha studied in the same college in Shadnagar during 2010 to 2012 and became friends. Amit then professed love for her and started harassing her, police said.

The victims' mother had talked to Amit's father thrice and asked him to warn his son. But Amit's father didn't stop his son and Amit continued harassing Srilekha, police said.

Two months ago Srilekha had warned Amit in strong words about not harassing her. He then decided to kill her.

On July 14 he forced entry into her house. When Srilekha's elder sister Yamini tried to stop him, he stabbed her wildly and then stabbed Srilekha. Both the girls died in the hospital.

Amit fled to Itarasi and from there to Mathura. He then visited Ajmer where he approached a godman, seeking to speak to Srilekha's 'spirit'. The godman asked him to come after 40 days, because her spirit ('aatmaa') was not 'available'.

From Ajmer Amit went to Surat, Shirdi and then back to Mathura where he met his parents and took shelter there.

When city police reached Mathura on his trail, he had left for Hyderabad. Police caught him near Medchal on the outskirts of Hyderabad today.

Chaitanyapur police have registered a case of murder and 'house trespass after preparation for hurt, assault or wrongful restraint' under relevant sections of IPC. Further probe is on.
