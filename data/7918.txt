Description:
			A Class VII girl from an Alipurduar village was stabbed in the neck by a youth last night when she resisted his alleged molest attempt.

The 14-year-old girl has been admitted to a hospital.

Police sources said, when the girl was cleaning utensils outside her home around 10 last night, Tapas Bhowmick grabbed her from behind. The girl tried to push him away and raised the alarm. The youth took out a knife, stabbed the girl in the neck twice and fled.

Today, the girl's grandfather lodged a police complaint naming the 22-year-old youth.

Alipurduar police superintendent Avaru Ravindranathan said: "We have started a probe and we are looking for the youth."

The girl was taken to the hospital around 11.30pm.

The grandfather said the girl's mother passed away when she was a child and her father left the house. "Since then, she has been staying with us," he said.
