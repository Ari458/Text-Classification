Molestation
Description:
			A 24 year old man threatens an 18 year old Dalit girl with a knife when she goes to relieve herself in the field.

The moment he tries to force himself upon her she snatches away the knife and castrates Raees Ahmad.

The incident happened at Chindauri village in Meerut late Thursday evening. As per the sources, the moment he tried to pull the girl into the field in a secluded area and forced himself upon him, she snatched away the knife and attacked his private part.

Soon after, villagers gathered at the spot after hearing Ahmad's screams. According to Arjun Singh, incharge of Lawar police post, "Raees Ahmad was writhing in pain while the blood was oozing out of his groin. He was immediately taken to Daurala community health centre but considering his worsening state, he was moved to district hospital."

Since the matter pertains to two communities, heavy police force has been deployed in the village. As per the sources, Ahmad is a married man and had left the house on the pretext of taking bath at a tubewell in one of the agricultural fields.

"Relatives of both individuals are at the police station and complaint is being filed by both the groups. Once formal complaint is registered we will take action in this matter", said Singh.
