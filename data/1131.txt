Abuse
Description:
			In 1998, Dr Mahalakshmi had separated from her husband and was living with her daughter. She started her private clinic at a rented place in Mysore. From day one, Chikkabasavaiah (Accused) started harassing her. He even clicked her pictures and spread a rumour that she was married to him. 

To escape his torture, she shifted the clinic to a crowded area close to her parents' house. But he kept harassing her. One day, while returning home, Chikkabasavaiah waylaid her vehicle and misbehaved with her. 

On January 11, 2001, Dr Mahalakshmi and her daughter were walking along a lane leading to their house when Chikkabasavaiah accosted them. He was desperate and, in a flash, threw acid on her face.
