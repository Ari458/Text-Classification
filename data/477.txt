Street Harassment
Description:
			A 25-year-old woman was allegedly molested by a man in Timarpur area of north Delhi on Monday night. The accused, however, escaped after the incident and has not been identified yet. 

"The victim is preparing for competitive exams. Last night around 10.30pm, while she was making a call to her parents from a public booth, a person allegedly came from behind and molested her. On hearing the girl shout for help, a neighbour came to the rescue. He even managed to nab the accused person," said a police officer.

Later when they were taking the accused to a nearby police station, a group of persons suddenly gathered and started beating up the accused. Taking advantage of the commotion, the accused managed to escape, said police.

Notes:
1. Molesting in Public places is a stark reminder of how the culprits are completely fearless of the people and the community.
2. The North East Network Helpline are putting pressure on the police to find the culprit soon.
3. How many of you think she was wrong in going out to make a call at 10.30 in the night? Can we really think so? A woman cant come out of her house to make an urgent phone call because she is at the risk of being molested by savages?
