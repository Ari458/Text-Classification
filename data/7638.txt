Description:
			A well-known lawyer in the city is in trouble after a woman filed a complaint, charging him with sexually abusing and blackmailing her. A case was filed at Satyanarayanapuram police station on Saturday against advocate P Tata Rao. 

The accused lawyer has been pestering the victim with amorous advances. He has even threatened to post photographs online of his dalliance with her. In her complaint, she alleged that Tata Rao managed to take obscene photographs of hers without her notice. She said that he used to blackmail her to live-in with him. 

It all began a year ago when the woman, who runs a kirana shop in Purnanandampeta, took a loan of Rs 2 lakh from Tata Rao for expanding her business. Though she has been paying instalments promptly, Tata Rao made her transfer the power of attorney of the house she has been living in his name. The woman lost her husband and has been staying single. 

With Tata Rao harassing her constantly, she approached the women's groups who took her to police commissioner Gautam Sawang. 

The task force enquired the matter. Tata Rao has been charged under sections 376, 448 and 335(D) of IPC.
