Description:
			Deenanath Tiwari, 39, killed his wife Shiakali, 37, and four daughters - aged 4-10 years - with an axe at his house in Poorakalandar town. Preliminary investigations indicate a marital dispute could be the reason.

"We have learnt that Shiakali had strained relations with Deenanath. He often used to beat Shiakali and his four daughters. It appears Deenanath had a verbal duel with his wife, and thereafter committed the killings in a fit of rage," Police Inspector A.K. Mishra told reporters in Faizabad, some 120 km from Lucknow.
