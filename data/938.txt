Description:
			The police said the victim was having a live-in relationship with the accused who had befriended her and promised marrying her and the two had started living together in the neighbouring Gurgaon over the last one month.

“However, the accused recently started ignoring her pleas of marriage and was also having a relationship with another girl which irked the victim. When she confronted him, the accused told her that he doesn’t remember any such promise and that he will abandon her if she were to raise the issue of marriage with him again,” a senior police official said.
