Abduction, Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			Two sisters, 13 and 16 years of age, were allegedly raped by their landlord and three accomplices in Binola village, Gurgaon, Saturday night. 

Police said the girls had arrived a month ago from Madhya Pradesh with their mother and brother, who were searching for work. They had rented a house in Binola village belonging to Ramavtar, 50, the prime accused. 

On Saturday night, the four accused entered the house in a drunken state, assaulted the mother and brother before locking them in a room. They then abducted the girls and took them to an undisclosed location and repeatedly raped them. 

On Sunday morning, the victims' mother registered a complaint at Bilaspur police station. She claimed the accused were eyeing the girls since they had arrived. A specially-constituted panel of doctors carried out medical examinations of the victims and sent the report to Madhuban forensic lab. Police said rape can be confirmed only after they get the report. 

The four accused, Ramavtar, Ram Kishan (30), Mantosh and Ombir, both 22, were arrested on Sunday afternoon. During the interrogation, they claimed they had been accused as they had forced the family to move out of their property on Saturday. 

"The accused claim the charges are false. An FIR has been registered against the accused under sections 376-D, 342, 448, 452, 323, 506 of IPC and the POCSO act," said Vivek Sharma, joint commissioner of police (crime), Gurgaon. 

Police have formed a special team of child protection officers and councillors, to help the girls recover from the trauma.
