Rape
Description:
			Sabarmati Police is probing a rare complaint of rape, lodged by a wife against her husband. According to police sources, the woman, who lives alone with her children alleged that her husband, who had come to see their ailing daughter, raped her during the night, against her wishes.

However, police have not yet acted against the husband as they are probing why the complaint was lodged one day later. The incident took place on the intervening night of December 4 and 5. According to the complaint, married for about 18 years, the couple separated about a year and a half ago. "They have a 17-year-old son and a 15-year-old daughter," said a police officer. Police sources said the husband came to see their sick daughter on December 4 and had even taken her to hospital for treatment.

"However, after returning from the hospital, the husband insisted on staying back. He was allowed this and committed the alleged offence that night," added a senior police official.
Sources said the woman called the women's helpline, after which she and her husband were taken to the police station.

"The wife was then taken to Civil hospital for a medical examination. We have registered an offence under section 376 of IPC against the husband and are probing the case," said a Sabarmati police official.
