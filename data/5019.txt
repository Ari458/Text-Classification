Rape
Description:
			A local court has sentenced a man to 10 years' imprisonment for helping his nephew rape his wife so that she could conceive and give birth to a baby. 

The nephew was also given a 10-year jail term. 

Apart from the rigorous imprisonment, the court also imposed a fine of Rs 1,000 each on Pentam Raju and his nephew Naveen. 

According to the prosecution, on January 12, 2010, Naveen raped Raju's wife at the couple's residence, with Raju holding her down. 

Both were arrested by Narayanaguda police after the victim lodged a complaint. 

Probe revealed that Raju and the victim married in 2004 and a daughter was born to them. But the child died within a few days of the birth, and after that the victim never conceived. 

Therefore, Raju wanted her to have a sexual intercourse with Naveen and get pregnant, which led to the rape.
