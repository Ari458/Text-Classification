Description:
			The Swargate police have arrested the registrar of a city-based educational institute for allegedly molesting a 40-year-old woman employee. 

The woman (name withheld) is the in-charge of the institute's girls hostel since 2006. She told police that she had filed an application with the registrar (name withheld) seeking his intervention for resolving her salary dispute. She had told him that the institute was wrongly deducting her house rent and other allowances since two months. 

The registrar issued an order to adjust her pending allowances in the next salary. While her past dues were paid, she found her travel allowance was stopped. 

Senior inspector Deepak Nikam, in charge of the Swargate police station, said, "The woman met the registrar in his office again and sought an explanation for the fresh deduction. She has written in her complaint that the registrar caught her hand and invited her for dinner and promised to resolve the issue." The woman ran out of his office and informed her husband, who then took her to the police station to register a complaint. She also accused the registrar of allegedly misbehaving and harassing her physically and mentally. The registrar has been arrested under sections 354 (molestation) and 354 (a) (sexual harassment) of the Indian Penal Code.
