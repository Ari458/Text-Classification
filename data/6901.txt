Molestation
Description:
			Dholka police on Thursday arrested probationer professor Hasmukh Limbachia for molesting his former collegemate. The 21-year-old complainant girl and Limbachia used to study in the same college. 

Police sources said that the girl has alleged that Limbachia also used to follow her when she used to come to Sola to attend her college which she had joined for further studies. 

"The girl then submitted an application of complaint against the professor," said a police source. 

"The accused was senior to the girl in the college. Earlier also Limbachia had attempted to come near the girl but was not successful," said a police official. 

Dholka police officials added that two days ago when the girl was doing some household work in the verandah of her house, Limbachia rushed in and molested her. However, as the girl's mother came out, Limbachia fled away. The girl then lodged a complaint with Dholka police. 

"We have arrested the professor under charges of molestation," said a Vatva police official.
