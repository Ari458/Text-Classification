Rape
Description:
			A 45-year-old woman was repeatedly raped by her alcoholic son, police said on Sunday, adding that her relatives, including husband, turned down her requests for help.

The alleged rapist, a 25-year-old resident of Pala in Kottayam district, was arrested. He has confessed to the crime, investigators said.

The incident came to light after the woman approached the police for help on Saturday evening. Based on the woman's complaint, the police arrested her son (name withheld to protect the woman's identity).

"A first information report was registered and the woman was subjected to a medical examination. A potency test on the youth was also conducted," police sub-inspector K P Thomson said. The accused has been sent to judicial custody.

Quoting the complainant, police said she had been undergoing the ordeal for the past couple of months. The accused allegedly used to rape her under the influence of alcohol, and once even forced open the bathroom door to violate his mother.

When the son repeated the offence, she informed her husband, a daily wage worker. When he did nothing to save her from further humiliation, she complained to her relatives.

Investigators said woman's relatives refused to intervene, saying the matter was between the mother and son, and they should settle the issue. It was then that the woman decided to approach the police with a complaint. Police said the accused has one younger brother and sister, and they stayed in an isolated place.

Expressing shock over the incident, state women's commission member J Pramila Devi said the panel would initiate awareness programmes to stop such incidents.

"The need of the hour is the efficient functioning of 'jagratha samithis' in all local bodies," she said.
