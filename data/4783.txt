Rape
Description:
			A 21-year-old medical student has complained of being raped by her boyfriend, who is an engineering student, at the latter's Borivali West residence on Wednesday. The victim said she had gone to end their relationship when the incident took place. The accused is yet to be arrested. 

According to the police, the couple was in a relationship for the past four years. The victim stopped conversing with the accused, Abhishek Ayare, 21, recently. Ayare was then trying to get in touch with her constantly. 

"On Wednesday afternoon, the victim finally answered his repeated phone calls. Ayare then requested her to meet him at his residence. He told her that he wanted to sort out issues between them and find out why she had stopped communicating with him," said an official from the MHB Colony police station. 

The victim refused to meet him initially, but he managed to convince her to come down. Around 2 pm, she reached Ayare's flat at Eksar Road in Borivali West. "The couple got into a heated argument at the accused's flat. Ayare's family members were not at home at that time. He assaulted the victim and raped her. He also threatened her against disclosing the incident to anyone," the official added. 

Around 3 pm, the victim stumbled out of his flat. On reaching home, she narrated everything to her parents. They then approached the police. Officials said the couple were acquainted with each since junior college. 

"We are trying to trace Ayare. We have also contacted the management of the college where he is studying. Neighbours are being quizzed," said the official. The victim has been sent for a medical examination.
