Foeticide/Infanticide
Description:
			In a shocking case of female infanticide, a 27-year-old-woman who allegedly killed her two-day-old girl child three years ago was arrested.

"The woman has been remanded to judicial custody. She is now lodged in Salem Prison," Dharmapuri Police Superintendent Asra Garg told PTI.

Asked how the murder remained under wraps for three years, investigating officer and Karimangalam Police Inspector S Baskara Babu said certain infant death cases were being pursued again based on suspicion.

"The post-mortem report had indicated fracture in hyoid bone region of the neck. Based on suspicion we interrogated the child's mother. She spilled the beans," he said.

The woman, Yasodha, a farm labourer of Ettiyanur village in Dharmapuri district decided to allegedly strangulate the child to death as she already had two girl children.

Pretending that the child had fallen sick, she took the infant to Palacode government hospital where it was declared brought dead.

Asked if the family of her husband, Murugan, a truck driver had any role, police said, "as a fifth girl child of her parents, Yasodha had endured hardship in life and decided to end the life of her child as she feared for the infant's future." 

The child was born on August 6, 2011 and was allegedly killed two days later and an autopsy was done on the same day, the investigating officer added.

Dharmapuri district is infamous for female infanticide in Tamil Nadu.
