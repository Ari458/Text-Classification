Murder, Rape
Description:
We suspect that the girl was strangled to death and the murder had taken place in some other district. Initial probe reveals that the victim might have been raped by the assailants before she was killed. The victim's body was thrown into a shrub near a residential area. 
The body was completely decomposed and the police could not recognise the victim's face.
