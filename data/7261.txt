Abduction, Rape
Description:
			A small-time businessman who struck a friendship with a 21-year-old woman allegedly kidnapped and raped her a number of times over a period of one year, prompting the Mohali police to register a case on Saturday.

The FIR was registered after the woman's father lodged a complaint before chief judicial magistrate Shiv Mohan Garg. He said Parwinder Singh, the accused, came in contact with his daughter over the social networking site in 2013. The complaint stated that the two exchanged their cell phone numbers and photographs. The two became good friends and spoke often. The accused, who used to visit Mohali regularly, called the woman to a hotel in Phase I in January 2014. When she reached, he offered her a chocolate laced with sedatives and allegedly raped her. The father alleged the accused kidnapped his daughter and took her to Uttar Pradesh. "She was repeatedly raped there," the FIR stated.

Police sources said the woman somehow managed to approach her parents over phone and disclosed her location. In July, her father rescued her from Dhampur in Bijnaur district. The accused, however, escaped. The woman was brought to Mohali, where her medical examination was conducted. The accused was booked for rape (section 376) and cheating (section 420).

Police sources said teams were formed to nab the accused and they could be sent to Uttar Pradesh.
