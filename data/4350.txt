Rape
Description:
			Congress MLA A P Abullakutty was booked on rape and other charges on a complaint by a woman accused in solar scam related cases.

A case under IPC sections 376 (rape), 354 (a) (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to disrobe her) and 506 (criminal intimidation) was registered by the Cantonment 'Vanitha' (women) Police Station against Abdullakutty after the solar scam accused lodged a written complaint.

In the complaint, the woman had alleged that she was sexually abused in a hotel in the city by the Kannur MLA and claimed he had threatened against revealing his name.

She also alleged that Abdullakutty used to make frequent telephone calls and many times the language used by him was abusive in nature.

The complainant, who is out on bail in the solar scam cases, had on March 3 made the allegations in the media, but Abdullkutty had then refuted her charges, saying they were "totally unfounded." 

The complainant is a prime accused in the solar scam rocking the Congress-led UDF Government for over a year.

Abdullakutty was formerly with CPI-M and was elected twice on the party ticket to Parliament before joining Congress.

After spending about nine months in prison in as many 33 solar scam related cases, the complainant had obtained bail in all the cases about three weeks ago.

The solar case pertains to cheating of huge amounts of money from many people by the complainant and Biju Radhakrishnan offering them solutions for setting up solar plants.

The case assumed a serious political dimension with one of the close personal aides of Chief Minister Oommen Chandy getting arrested in connection with the scam.
