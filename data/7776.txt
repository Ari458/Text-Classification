Child Sexual Abuse, Molestation, Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			The Assam Police have registered a complaint against an MLA accused of sexually harassing his minor domestic help.

Cases under section 343 of Indian Penal Code and sections 4 and 8 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act were slapped against All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) legislator Gopinath Das based on an FIR filed by the 14-year-old girl on Sunday night.

Section 343 prescribes a maximum two-year imprisonment, with or without fine, for wrongful confinement of any person for three or more days.

We are approaching the case legally for interrogation of the MLA, Indrani Baruah, Kamrup district superintendent of police, said.

However, Das said the complaint was a conspiracy hatched by my political rivals to tarnish my image ahead of the assembly elections scheduled early next year.

He added that he had filed a missing report with the police on Sunday morning. He had in that report said the girl had fled with cash and clothes.

In her complaint, the victim accused Das of subjecting her to sexual harassment in his vehicle on August 29.

But how can this be possible? My driver and personal security officers always accompany me. If I had any intention of sexual assault, I could have easily done it in my residence, the MLA said.

Das, who represents the Boko assembly constituency, had employed the girl on June 28.
