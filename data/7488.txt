Domestic Violence
Description:
			A 55-year-old sweeper has been booked on Saturday for attacking his wife with acid, apparently after he suspected her of having an affair, police said.

The 40-year-old woman suffered 30% burns on her body and is recuperating at a Delhi hospital. The man is absconding.

The victim, a domestic help, lives in Sikanderpur with her husband and their two sons. The accused also has two sons from his first marriage. The husband had suspected that she was having an affair. He questioned her about it often and even followed her, which led to frequent arguments.

The couple quarrelled on Friday again. Later, around 11 pm, the husband poured acid over his sleeping wife. She received deep burns on her face, neck, chest, arms and thighs. Her sons and neighbours gathered hearing her cries and tried to help by pouring water. However, when they realized that the burns were too deep, they took her to General Hospital in Civil Lines at 3 am.

Doctors at the hospital referred her to Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi and informed police. A case was registered against the husband, under IPC Section 326A (causing permanent or partial damage by throwing acid).

Police said the accused had access to acid as he worked as a sweeper. He took his mobile phone with him when he fled. Police are tracking it to nab him.

"We lodged an FIR at the DLF I PS.

The woman is admitted at a Delhi hospital with 30% burns, but is out of danger," said ACP (crime) Rajesh Kumar.
