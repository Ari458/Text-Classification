Molestation
Description:
			Bollywood singer Abhijeet Bhattacharya was booked on sexual harassment charges on Thursday for allegedly misbehaving with a 34-year-old woman at a Durga Puja pandal at the Lokhandwala Complex in Andheri. Subhash Khanvilkar, senior inspector at the Oshiwara police station, said the complainant, an invitee to the pandal, was obstructing the view of the audience during live performances at the pandal when Abhijeet tried to move her away. 

“She has lodged a complaint that Abhijeet allegedly touched her inappropriately,” Mr. Khanvilkar said. She alleged that she was later taken to the pandal office by Abhijeet and threatened.

Mr. Bhattacharya denied the molestation charge at a press conference on Friday. He said he had an argument with the woman for disturbing the audience during a live performance by singer Kailash Kher.

“I have never seen this woman before,” he said.
