Dowry Harassment
Description:
			Kavitha, 32, of Sulur, had complained to All Women's police station in Perur that her husband and in-laws were harassing her for a dowry of Rs 20 lakh.

She had married Raja of Namakkal district in 2005 and the couple has a six-year-old boy. A few years after their marriage, Kavitha went to England for studies and her husband joined her in 2010. Once there, Raja didn't take a job and would harass Kavitha under the influence of alcohol, seeking money, police said.

Raja even withdrew Rs 1 lakh with his wife's ATM card without her knowledge. When she questioned him, a quarrel ensued and Raja harassed her severely. Unable to bear the torture, she lodged a complaint with police in England but later withdrew it, police said.

Subsequently Kavitha returned to India and started living with her parents. However, Raja, his father Sengottaiyan and their relative Ramalingam, visited her and demanded Rs 20 lakh if she wanted to be united with her husband.
