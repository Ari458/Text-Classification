Rape
Description:
			38-year-old Hanumanthappa from Government Higher Secondary School at Korlagundi would ask the 13-year- old student to stay back after school hours and assault her. The girl suffered in forced silence for the past six months as the teacher had threatened to fail her in exams if she spoke up.

When the teacher allegedly tried to assault her on Jan 26, she offered resistance and fled from the scene. Later, she confided in a friend and swore her to secrecy. But the friend thought it important to inform the headmaster.
