Abduction, Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A 14-year-old girl, who had gone missing on April 5 and returned after three days, told police three youngsters from neighbourhood kidnapped her and one of them raped her in Revti area on city's outskirts. Her statement flies in face of an earlier one she had made before camera at Banganga police station on April 8. In earlier statement the minor had reportedly told the police she had left house on her own and denied any wrongdoing with her.

The rape survivor alleged that three youths from the locality Kalu, Akash and Ravi Tewra, all between 20 and 25 years of age kidnapped her with help of Kalu's grandmother on April 5 from Banganga area and took her to Bijasen Tekri temple in Aerodrome area.

They, she alleged, later locked her up in a room in Revti area. When Kalu raped her for three days, his two friends Akash and Ravi stood guard outside. But she somehow managed to escape from clutches of the trio on March 8 and returned to her parents in Banganga area, she claimed.

Banganga police station in charge Yogesh Singh Tomar said a case of rape has been lodged against Kalu. Akash and Ravi and Kalu's grandmother have been booked on charge of the girl's abduction.

The girl has been sent to a government hospital for medical examination.

The survivor's uncle Gopal alleged that there was delay in lodging the rape case and a woman sub-inspector had even misbehaved with the minor at the time of recording statement.

Banganga police station in charge, however, denied allegations and said thorough investigations were needed before lodging the rape case as the girl on April 8 had denied any wrongdoing.
