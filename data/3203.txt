Rape
Description:
			Kyatasandra police on Tuesday registered a rape case against a 23-year-old man for allegedly raping his 12-year-old niece who delivered a baby boy on Monday. She's the daughter of the accused's elder sister.

Her family, including her mother, initially declined to file a police complaint. But Kyatasandra police in Nelamangala taluk of Bangalore Rural district on Tuesday went to the Class VII student of Dobbespet Government School and took her written statement.

Police said the man confessed to the crime but claimed it was "by consent". "The accused lived with the girl's family. Her mother now says she will get her daughter married to the accused. But it's against the law as the girl is a minor," an investigating officer said.

"Having a physical relationship with a girl below 18 is an offence and leads to rape charges. According to law, there is nothing like consensual sex with a minor," police said.

"We acted under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 and arrested the accused," they added.

Police are surprised by the claims of the girl's mother and other family members that they were ignorant of the crime till the girl delivered a child. "It's hard to believe that no one in the family, friends, classmates or others noticed she was pregnant," police added.
