Rape
Description:
			A 19-year-old housewife from Karimnagar district, who had come to city in search of work, was gang-raped by two persons in Saifabad, the police said on Friday. 

According to police, the woman left the house of her in-laws on Wednesday after quarrelling with them on some family matter. She decided to live separately and came to city to find work. After getting off the bus at Mahatma Gandhi Bus Station, she came to Lakdikapul and slept at a bus-stop shelter. In the early hours of Thursday, the woman noticed that her bag containing Rs. 150 and mangalasutra was stolen. 

As the woman started crying, Sami accompanied by his two friends approached her. Assuring help, he asked her to get into his three-wheeler and took her to different locations in the surrounding areas. After some time, the trio took the woman into an old building near Nirakari Bhavan. Sami and his friend violated her. The woman managed to escape from their clutches and raised an alarm. On seeing the approaching locals, the trio fled the place.
