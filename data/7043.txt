Description:
			An 18-year-old girl received injuries on her face and feet after a youth threw acid on her late on Friday night in Nandapur village in Paschim Medinipur district.

Ironically, the attack came hours after the results of the Higher Secondary examinations were declared in which she scored about 80 per cent marks.

According to the girl's family, she was asleep with her mother and brother at the first floor of their residence when the attacker threw acid. Her mother and brother also sustained injuries.

Her family suspected that the attacker did it in a fit of anger as she had recently turned down a marriage proposal from him. Her family was celebrating her success at the Higher Secondary examinations till late on Friday night.

One person has been detained in connection with the attack, said District Additional SP Abhishek Gupta.

One person has been detained and interrogation is on. We are speaking to other villagers as well to find out if more people were involved. We are yet to ascertain whether he is a juvenile, Mr. Gupta said.

While she was rushed to a local hospital, she is currently undergoing treatment at the city's SSKM Hospital.

She sustained serious injuries on her face.

During 2014, at least 130 persons were targeted, including 29 from West Bengal, according to the data compiled by the Acid Survivors Foundation India, an NGO that works with survivors.
