Molestation, Crime
Description:
			Bollywood actress Shruti Haasan has registered a molestation and house tresspassing complaint against an unidentified stalker who allegedly tried to barge into her suburban Bandra West residence.

No arrests have been made in the case so far.

The incident had occurred at about 9.30 am when 27-year-old Shruti Haasan, daughter of noted actor Kamal Haasan, answered the door bell of her sixth floor apartment in a building at Bandra West.

She was confronted by a stalker who allegedly tried to barge into the apartment and also asked her why she had failed to "recognise" him.

The accused had even put his hand on the actress' shoulder. Although she was rattled, she managed to push the man away and lock the door.

According to the actress, the accused was spotted on the sets of her films on a few occasions and also seen at Mehboob Studio as well as Film City studio where she had shot earlier.

The police have obtained CCTV footage of the residential building. The man is seen in the footage and they are in the process of identifying him. The accused had made an entry in the building's visitor diary as 'Ashok' but it may be a fake name.
