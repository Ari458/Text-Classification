Description:
			Two days after sexual assault on minor tribal girls at a hostel in Pali region of Korba district, collector suspended three officials for dereliction of duty on Saturday. Those suspended include hostel superintendent Manjulata Uikey, house warden Ambika Markam and block education officer SN Sahu.

Hostel superintendent Uikey, who was absent without information from hostel when the incident took place, was suspended for carelessness towards her responsibilities in work.

According to suspension order a copy of which was released by directorate of public relations, Korba, during her inspection in hostel, collector Reena Babasaheb Kangle found Uikey had not informed about her absenteeism from hostel nor had she taken any permission from block education officer which collector termed as offence and deserves disciplinary actions.

House warden Markam's role came to light two days after the incident when it was revealed she delayed informing senior officials about the incident. Ambika has been charged with not playing an active role in preventing politicians from entering hostel premises. As per rules, she was supposed to call nearest police station on forced entry of anyone inside hostel premises, which she didn't.

BEO Sahu was suspended for delay in acting and not reporting the matter to police immediately after the incident took place, the order said. Sahu has been attached to Government High School Choda in Pali block as principal while Pramod Saxena has been given the charge of BEO Pali.

All three officials were suspended by commissioner, tribal welfare Srikant Dubey after district collector Kangle's inspection report and recommendations.

Opposition Congress on Friday constituted a committee, headed by former minister Premsai Singh, to inquire into the circumstances that led to the Pali girls' hostel incident.
