Murder
Description:
			A local court today awarded life imprisonment to a 30-year-old man for killing a woman during her wedding ceremony here last year.

District and Sessions judge Sushma Khosla awarded life imprisonment to Anurag Namdeo and slapped on him a fine of Rs 15,000.

According to prosecution, the bride, Dr Jaishri Namdeo, was standing on the stage with her groom Dr Rohit Namdeo as their wedding was being solemnised on May 8, 2014, at a marriage garden on the city's outskirts when Anurag reached there and shot her dead from a close range.

The accused, who is Jaishri's cousin (son of the victim's aunt) had also tried to kill Rohit but the latter caught his hand and the bullet hit another person, injuring him seriously.

Jaishri was rushed to hospital where doctors declared her dead.

Anurag, who worked in a private bank as a supervisor, was allegedly in love with his cousin and could not come to terms with the fact that she was getting married to some other person.

The family members were aware of Anurag's feelings and therefore, they had not invited him to the marriage function.

However, Anurag went there and on reaching near the stage, he pulled out a revolver and shot at Jaishri, the prosecution told the court.

The accused was later caught by those present at the marriage function and handed over to the police.

Police had recorded the statement of 17 witnesses in connection with the case.
