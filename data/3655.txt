Murder
Description:
			An 18-year-old youth was arrested for allegedly murdering a three-year-old daughter of his neighbour.

The accused Gajanan Murmure had been misleading the police since the girl went missing on November 17 and tried to pass on the incident as "sacrificial killing". He was later arrested.

Murmure allegedly killed the girl by banging her head against the wall of his house as she was crying inconsolably since he had scolded her for playing in sand he had stored for construction of his new house.

Murmure had smeared red, yellow and white colours on the body of the girl before dumping it in a trench dug out for the construction of new house, to pass on the incident as sacrificial killing.

The accused had even joined his neighbours, with whom he has a long pending dispute, in search of the child.

Police had drawn flak for failing to crack the case and an agitation was held.

The investigation was finally handed over to the Anti-riot control wing of the LCB.

During the course of investigation, police rejected the rumour that the victim was sacrificed for the sake of hidden treasure, and even detained two suspects in this regard.

Murmure killed her in a fit of rage as she was inconsolable. He was afraid that the girl will tell her parents that Murmure had scolded her.
