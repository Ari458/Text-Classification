Description:
			The J.P. Nagar police have arrested a delivery boy for allegedly putting a client's phone number on a messaging platform and passing her off as an escort.

The accused is Shreyas, who works for an online food service provider. The police said the woman had ordered a pizza on June 8, but later cancelled as she did not like the food. This led to an argument with Shreyas refusing to accept the cancellation.

Eventually, Shreyas left the parcel outside the woman's house and then shared her number on WhatsApp stating that she is an escort.

When the woman began receiving calls from strangers, she filed a complaint with the police, who tracked down the people and zeroed in on Shreyas.
