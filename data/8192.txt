Dowry Harassment
Description:
			India Post employee has committed suicide due to alleged dowry harassment by her husband at Prakash Nagar, Begumpet.

Begumpet police said Lakshmi, 25, was found hanging by her house owner on Wednesday . Her husband was not at home when the incident happened.

"The owner became suspicious as none came out of the house when GHMC officials were distributing new bins. When the owner peeped through the window, he saw Laxmi hanging from the ceiling fan," Begumpet sub-inspector D Naga Raju said.

Lakshmi, a clerk at the Begumpet post office, had married Yugesh, a software engineer, in 2013. Yugesh, who is currently unemployed, and his parents reportedly demanded additional dowry and harassed her over petty issues.
To escape the daily harassment, Lakshmi even had left her house for a few days and, later police traced her following a complaint six months ago. Following this incident, the troubles she was facing came to light. "Lakshmi died on Tuesday and the incident came to light on Wednesday," police said.
