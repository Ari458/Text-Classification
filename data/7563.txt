Rape
Description:
			A Delhi court has awarded seven years jail term to a man for raping his neighbhour, saying the convict has "committed the vile act" and deserves to be suitably punished for it. "We must see the plight of the prosecutrix, who was subjected to rape, which is universally considered to be the amongst the most morally and physically, reprehensible crime in society and assault on the body, mind, privacy and the entire fabric of the victim," Additional Sessions Judge (ASJ) Sanjiv Jain said. 

The court further said that the dignity of the victim is "shredded" and "the social stigma attached to this crime is such that many a times, a crime would go unreported by the victim. The convict in this case has committed the vile act of rape and deserves to be suitably punished for it".

It had said that the accused was fully aware that the woman's husband was not at home and her children had gone for tuition and thus entered her house, gagged her mouth and raped her.
