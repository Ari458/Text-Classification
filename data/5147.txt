Rape
Description:
			Gittikhadan police have booked a gym trainer for raping his divorcee wife. Accused Vinod Bhavsar, 38, is a resident of Jalgaon. The police said the complainant is a highly educated woman and is employed as a physical trainer at a school in Jalgaon.

However, due to growing differences between them, the two had applied for divorce. In between, the complainant had also filed a case of domestic violence against Bhavsar.

Police said that their divorce had been granted some months back. However, the woman had by then shifted to her parents' residence at Gittikhadan and did not know of it. On April 29, Bhavsar had come to Nagpur and forced the woman to have sexual intercourse.

The woman filed a rape complaint on Saturday when she came to know that her divorce had been granted by court some months earlier.
