Molestation, Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			Tension prevailed in the Acharya Nagarjuna University engineering college campus after a second year B.Tech girl student complained of "harassment" by an assistant professor.

Relatives of the girl student staged a road blockade agitation on national highway 5, while supporters of the accused professor also resorted to counter protests.

The girl student alleged that the professor had been "pursuing" her by sending cellular phone SMS text messages and that he had invited her to his room and made "indecent overtures".

However, the assistant professor vehemently denied the charges and alleged that the girl was involved in several love affairs and that he had advised her to inform the police about the SMS messages.

Television channels crews were also attacked for their "over enthusiasm" to "exaggerate" the "trivial" incident.
