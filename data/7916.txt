Child Sexual Abuse, Human Trafficking, Rape
Description:
			Trafficking and sexual abuse of a minor girl from Gajapati district in Goa has come to the fore after the 16-year-old delivered a girl child at Jaraganda village under Adava police limits, about a fortnight ago. The mother and child are recuperating in a hospital at Paralakhemundi.

On Wednesday, the girl complained to police that she was sexually exploited by Joseph Sabara of Bhalia Sahi in Birikote. He had taken her to Goa, about three years ago, by promising a job but engaged her as a maid servant in a house, police sources said. He also allegedly took all her earnings and promised to marry her, police added.

He was even reluctant to allow her to go when her father expired in June. On the intervention of her employer, Joseph brought her to Berhampur and fled. She was rescued by Childline campaigners after delivery of her child. "We have started inquiry basing on the girl's complaints," said sub-divisional police officer (R Udayagiri) R N Barik.

Director of Childline, Berhampur, Sudhir Sabat said the accused has allegedly trafficked several girls in the area to other states assuring them to provide job. "We will try to rehabilitate the girl," said district child protection officer (Gajapati) Arun Kumar Tripathy.
