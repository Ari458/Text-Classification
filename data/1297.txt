Description:
			A Pune-based engineer has been arrested by Mahatma Phule police in Kalyan for torturing his wife, and asking her to have sex with his friends after she refused to arrange for Rs. 5 lakh as dowry. In her complaint, the woman stated that the accused allegedly had sex with other girls in her presence.

According to Sakina (34), a B Com student and resident of Kalyan, she came to know before their wedding that Shaikh was an alcoholic and a smoker. She refused to marry him. To impress her, Imran went on a hunger strike for three days, denying himself food, cigarettes and wine. Sakina then accepted his proposal. The marriage was solemnised  on November 1, 2000 in Kalyan. Just 15 days later Shaikh allegedly thrashed Sakina, telling her that he wanted revenge from her, as she had dared to refuse his proposal. "While hitting me he said that he would make my life a living hell as I had turned down his proposal previously," said Sakina. 

The victim says her husband often brought girls to their residence and had sex with them in front of her. 

"His friends used to pass comments on my appearance, figure and at times molested me. When I opposed them, my husband used to abuse me. He even asked me to have sex with his friends, but I refused,"said Sakina.

Nine months ago Shaikh allegedly threw Sakina and their son out of their home. Sakina's brother Arif had tried to reason with him. But he allegedly threatened him saying he had contacts with Chhota Rajan, police and judges.
