Child Sexual Abuse, Molestation
Description:
			A 16-year-old girl has accused an administrative officer in Chhattisgarh's Raigarh district of molesting her, prompting police to order an inquiry into the matter.

The girl, in her complaint, has alleged that sub-divisional magistrate and Kharsiya joint collector AK Ghritlahre (55) molested her last month while she was working as a maid at his residence, Raigarh SP Sanjeev Shukla said.

However, the SDM has denied the allegations. "In view of the seriousness of the complaint, SDOP Puja Agrawal has been asked to investigate it and submit a report," Shukla said. As per the complaint, Ghritlahre had allegedly touched the girl inappropriately several times. He even frequently asked the girl stay late at night in the absence of his wife, the SP said.

The girl's parents had stopped their daughter from going to the officer's house when she narrated her ordeal to them. But, the officer then lodged an alleged fake case of theft against the girl, the SP said quoting her complaint.

According to the girl, she was mentally and physically tortured by Kharsiya police during the probe and when they did not find any evidence against her she was let off. Thereafter, the SDM also allegedly threatened the girl's family asking them not to reveal the incident (molestation) to anyone, the SP said.

The girl subsequently approached Shukla and Raigarh collector (in-charge) Nilesh Kshirsagar last evening following which they assured her of stern action against the officer if he is found guilty in the probe. Meanwhile, when asked to comment on the issue, SDM Ghritlahre denied the allegations leveled against him.
