Child Sexual Abuse, Molestation
Description:
			A 45-year-old man has been arrested for allegedly trying to rape his 12-year-old physically challenged daughter after returning home from work in an inebriated state. 

Mohammed Anish, a daily wage labourer who lives with his wife and five kids in the Bhandaribagh area, tried to take advantage of the girl when she was alone at home. The girl's screams alerted neighbours, who beat up the man before handing him over to the police. 

The victim, who is the eldest child in the family, needs crutches to walk and usually remains confined to the house. When the alleged crime took place, her siblings were playing outside the house, and her mother had gone to her parents' house. 

Police have recorded statements of the victim, her mother and two others.
