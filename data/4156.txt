Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A 14-year-old girl was allegedly raped by her 24-year-old neighbour in the Anand Prabat area. 

A case has been registered against Mohammad Saifulla at the Paharganj police station and he was arrested. 

The incident took place when the girl was alone at her home. 

Taking advantage of her being alone, the accused barged into her house and raped her. The girl didn't tell her parents about the rape that day. She just told them that a man molested her. 

Accordingly, an FIR for molestation was registered. 

But later, the girl recorded her statement before an SDM, stating that she was raped by Saifulla. A medical examination has confirmed rape.

After the girl's statement, Section 376 (rape) of IPC was added in the FIR.
