Murder, Rape
Description:
			Relatives of a 19-year-old girl complained to the Thane railway police here today that she was raped and pushed in front of a running suburban local train, after her body was found on the railway tracks between Thane and Kalwa at about 9 am.

Locals also alleged that when one of them went to the Kalwa police station to lodge a complaint, the police turned him down stating that it was not under their "jurisdiction".

The railway police stated that they could arrive at any conclusion and decide on the course of action only after a postmortem.

Meanwhile, the railway police has taken two people into custody, in connection with the incident and said that her body has been sent to the Thane Civil Hospital for postmortem.

The victim who resided in Dighe, Navi Mumbai, used to work in the NBZ Pharmaceutical Company, after which she used to attend computer classes at Anand Nagar at about 6 pm.

On Saturday, instead of returning home, she went to her friend's house and to the computer classes from there.
