Description:
			Dewas police on Friday booked a man for allegedly raping a 25-year-old woman and throwing her into Kshipra river. The accused was unaware that victim could swim. She escaped by swimming ashore.

Punish Pawar, a resident of Sukhlia area in Indore, took the woman to a lodge in Dewas and made physical relations with her. On the way back to Indore, he pushed her into Kshipra river on Thursday night, Dewas Industrial Area police station in-charge Shailendra Mukati told TOI.

The victim swam and covered more than 60 ft distance to reach ashore, he said adding apparently, Punish was not aware that the lady could swim.

The woman, a divorcee and a resident of Sethi Nagar in Indore, was married when she was young. She had three children from her marriage. She got divorced from her husband around four years ago.

The victim worked as a marriage event organizer for several years and was jobless for the last two years. She came in contact with Punish on social media around 18 months ago.

"The victim claimed that she had been having physical relations with Punish for the last four months," Mukati said adding Punish was also married and worked as an agent of automobile finance companies.

On Thursday, Punish took the woman to Nitin Lodge in Dewas where they booked a room. She alleged that here Punish made physical relations with her. While returning home in the car, Punish stopped the vehicle near Kshipra river claiming that he was facing discomfort. He took her on a ledge near the bridge and pushed her into the river.

The victim claimed that she managed to swim ashore and raise an alarm. People took her to the police station, where she narrated her tale.

The Industrial Area police have booked Punish for attempted murder and rape. Attempts were on to trace the accused, Mukati said.
