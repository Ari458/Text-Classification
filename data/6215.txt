Description:
			A 22-year-old girl was killed by four youths when she resisted their alleged bid to rape her in Naranpura area of the city, police said today.

Police said the incident took place last night when Vandana, who was staying at a working women's hostel in Naranpura area, and her friend Birbal Prasad (26), a native of Raigad in Maharashtra, were sitting near the rail tracks.

"Prasad arrived here last morning from Mumbai and booked a room in a hotel in Shahibaug area. As per Prasad's complaint, both of them first went to riverfront to spend some time and then came to the hotel room in evening. Later, they went to Usmanpura garden in an auto. At around 10:40 PM, the couple decided to take a walk near the railway track before departing," said Naranpura police inspector D R Dhamal.

The duo then decided to sit at a secluded place near the tracks when four youngsters suddenly arrived there and started harassing Vandana.

"They demanded sexual favours from her. When the couple put up some resistance and shouted for help, the youths allegedly attacked them with knives," Dhamal said.

He said some of the youths held Vandana and stabbed her in abdomen while others attacked Birbal.

"Later, Birbal called up police control room in midnight.

We took them to Sola civil hospital, where Vandana was declared dead," the officer added.
