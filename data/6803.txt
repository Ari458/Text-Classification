Rape
Description:
			A 22-year-old woman from Nepal was allegedly gang-raped by two men at a flat in southwest Delhi’s Dwarka on Monday night. Police arrested the two men who deal in real estate in and around Dwarka.

 Police sources said the woman had been in a live-in relationship with a married man, Devendra, for the past one year. The arrested men are known to the woman’s live-in partner. Devendra, who works as a taxi driver, had sent the woman to the flat with the two accused.

The arrested persons have been identified as Kishor Kumar Jain, 34, and Saurabh Sharma, 30. On Tuesday, they were produced before a city court that sent them to Tihar Jail. Both of them are married and have children.

 A senior police officer said the crime was discovered late on Monday night when the woman called the police control room (PCR) and reported that she was gang-raped by two men at their flat in Dwarka. A police team reached the place from where the women had made the PCR call.

 On the basis of her complaint, the officer said, a case of gang-rape was registered against the two suspects, who the woman claimed, were known to her live-in partner. She was taken to a government hospital where her medical examination confirmed rape. Her live-in partner was picked up for questioning and he disclosed the names of the suspects.

 “Raids were conducted at the hideouts of the two accused and they were finally arrested. During interrogation, the accused claimed that they had a dispute with the couple over money. Their claims are being verified,” the officer added.
