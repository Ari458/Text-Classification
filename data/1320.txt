Dowry Harassment
Description:
			Twenty-one-year-old MBA student whose marriage was fixed recently, and her mother were caught when they allegedly tried to rob a housewife in Kushaiguda on Friday as they ran short of money for dowry.

Her marriage was fixed recently and was to be held in a few days. Her father, a parking lot employee, reportedly agreed to pay some dowry.
He managed to gather some money but required an additional sum of Rs. 1 lakh towards dowry.
Sharada's mother hatched a plan to commit robbery and arrange money for the dowry.

Her family earlier lived next to Kalpana's house. She knew Kalpana would be alone in the house after her husband, Srikanth, leaves for office and attempted the robbery, the police said.
