Dowry Harassment
Description:
			The police booked a Kishangarh resident for allegedly driving his wife to suicide on Thursday night. The police said Simran Kaur, 20, was found hanging from a ceiling fan at her house by her sister. She sounded the police, who rushed Kaur to a hospital where she was declared brought dead.
 
The woman's husband, Lakhwinder Singh, claimed Kaur had ended her life as she was suffering from depression. However, her sister, Jyoti, alleged that Lakhwinder had been harassing Simran and often beat her up for not meeting his dowry demands since they got married in 2004, which drove her to suicide.
 
Earlier in July, Kaur's family members had filed a complaint at the Pinjore police station alleging she was being harassed for dowry.
