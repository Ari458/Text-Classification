Rape
Description:
			Police took into custody on Wednesday a 68-year-old teacher of a school run by the Karnataka Nair Service Society ( KNSS) in Dooravaninagar, Bangalore after he was accused of raping his 12-year-old student.

The girl complained to her mother, identified as Mary, on returning home from school on Tuesday evening. She told her mother that the teacher had been misbehaving with her for a long time. Parents and guardians of several students came to the school on Wednesday morning and fought with the school management on this issue. Around 9.30am, they even threw stones at the building and smashed several window glasses.
