Description:
			The convict, Manoj Kumar, was arrested in 2003, after police charged him and his mother for causing the death of his wife by constanty harassing her for dowry. It was established that during the short span of 15 months of the marriage, she had undergone abortions on two occasions when she suffered an infection and complications when both her ovaries had to be removed. 

However, Additional Sessions Judge Kamini Lau acquitted him on that charge for lack of evidence, instead, ruling that he be convicted for subjecting his wife to cruelty.
