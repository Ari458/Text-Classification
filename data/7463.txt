Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			The parents of a mentally challenged girl, who has allegedly been raped and is six months pregnant, have claimed that the police have not conducted a proper probe into their complaint.

The Mangolpuri police have arrested the driver who used to ferry the girl to her school. The parents, who belong to the lower income group, want the police to investigate the case further and ensure that the real culprits are caught.

My daughter is unable to tell us exactly what happened. She is not telling us who (person or persons) did this to her or when or where the assault took place, said the father. We want justice for our child.
The family has another child who is physically challenged.

The doctors have told us that my child's emotional and physical health is very fragile right now. She had displayed symptoms of anxiety and loss of appetite earlier this year, but I dismissed it thinking it was due to the pressure at school,said the mother.

When the girl's condition deteriorated further, the parents decided to take her to hospital.

The doctors suspected that my child may have been sexually assaulted and they checked for pregnancy. The tests came out positive, said the mother.

The parents alleged that the school authorities, after hearing their complaint, told them to take money for the child's treatment.

We also met some senior Delhi government officials who asked us to come back later, said the mother.

A senior health official said the case will be looked into and all help will be given to the girl. He added that the parents did approach Delhi Women and Child Development Minister Sandeep Kumar who extended all help, including medical treatment.
