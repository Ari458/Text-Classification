Description:
			A 32-year-old labourer allegedly stabbed to death his wife and her parents following a family dispute at Kethavaram village in East Godavari district.

The accused Krishnam Raju allegedly used to harass his wife Hemavathi (25) for dowry due to which she would often visit her parents' house in the village.

Hemavathi went to her parents' house following a quarrel with Raju. Raju reached her house and asked his in-laws V Abbayi (52) and V Kamala (48) to send her back but they refused. However, when they were asleep in the wee hours, Raju attacked them with a knife killing them on the spot.

According to police, when Hemavathi tried to intervene he also killed her. Raju's sister-in-law sustained serious injuries when she tried to ward him off and was admitted to Rajahmundry government hospital by villagers.

Raju took his two-year-old son along with him while fleeing and later handed him over to his parents.
