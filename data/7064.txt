Description:
			A fast track court today sentenced three persons to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment in Bokaro in a 2006 dowry killing case.

Following the order, Upendra Prasad (27), his father Ramashish Prasad (55) and Rajeshwari Devi (50) - residents of Balidih, Bokaro - were sent to jail.

Punam (19) was found dead in the Garga river in Bokaro in November 2006, eight months after she married Upendra, a shop owner, on March 2.

According to Punam's family, Upendra and his family had taken Rs 51,000 in cash and gold ornaments at the time of the marriage.

But, soon Upendra and his parents started assaulting Punam to mount pressure on her father R.K. Mahto, a daily wage labourer, to give a colour TV.

Unable to bear the torture, Punam had called Mahesh Singh, who used to live near her parents' place, on his phone on November 8, 2006, and told him that her in-laws were mercilessly beating her for a TV. She requested them to save her life.

The next day, her younger brother came to Balidih and found Punam dead.
