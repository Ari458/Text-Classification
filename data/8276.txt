Description:
			A 33-year-old man has been arrested by Kharar police for allegedly showing obscene pictures to two minor sisters and molesting them.

Sandeep Kumar, who owns a computers shop in Kharar and is married, was produced before a court on Friday and remanded in 14-day judicial custody. He has been charged with sections 354 A (sexual harassment) and 354B (criminal force to woman with intent to disrobe) and relevant sections of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (Pocso).

In his complaint, the victim's father has alleged that the accused had been coming to their house for the past two months to play with the children. However, recently, their mother caught the man showing the children his mobile phone.
