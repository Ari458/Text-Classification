Child Sexual Abuse, Murder, Rape
Description:
			A Class IV student was allegedly gang-raped and throttled to death in Murshidabad's Nabagram last night.

The 12-year-old's unclothed body was found with her hands and legs tied with her dupatta beside a bush on the banks of the Brahmvi river at Moharul village on Sunday morning by some villagers.

Police said the 12-year-old girl, who stayed with her three sisters next to her uncle's house, was missing since yesterday. "It appears she was throttled to death," a police officer said.

The girl's elder sister said that their mother, who was widowed four years ago, was a beggar in Moradabad, Uttar Pradesh, and sent them money occasionally.

The girl's uncle, who is a labourer and is the guardian of the sisters, today lodged a complaint saying that his niece was raped by more than one person and murdered. He named a local youth.

District superintendent of police C. Sudhakar said: "For now, we have started a murder case."

Asked why the police did not start a rape case, the SP said: "We are waiting for the post-mortem report. If the report indicates rape, then we will add the charge to the FIR."

The girl's uncle said that yesterday around 3pm, she and her younger sister had gone to the river to buy fish.

"My youngest niece returned home alone and told us that a local youth had called her elder sister to another side of the riverbank telling her that he would giver her fish. My youngest niece was told to wait. She later returned home alone after waiting on the riverbank till evening," said the uncle.

The uncle said that he started looking for her missing niece with the help of a neighbour.

"This morning, some villagers informed me that my niece's body has been found. There were two empty liquor bottles lying beside the body," said the uncle.
