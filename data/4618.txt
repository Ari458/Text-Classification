Rape
Description:
			A 25-year-old woman was allegedly raped by a compounder at a private hospital in Ranchi on Wednesday night. The accused, Ram Kumar Mahto, was arrested on Thursday morning after the survivor's husband filed a complaint with the local police.

A resident of Kanke, the woman was suffering from cerebral malaria and was admitted to the Kanke General Hospital on Wednesday. At 11pm, Mahto (22) came into her room on the pretext of administering her saline drip. He asked the patient's mother to go out and get more bottles of saline water which, according to him, was necessary to treat her daughter. The woman followed Mahto's instructions and immediately went out to bring more bottles. On returning, she (mother) found her daughter lying unconscious and raped, the FIR lodged with the police claimed.

Confirming the arrest, Ranchi superintendent of police (rural) S K Jha said, "The girl has been sent for medical tests. The rape will be confirmed only after we get the report."

A group of locals in Kanke, however, did not wait for the report to arrive and resorted to violence on Thursday. They pelted stones at the hospital smashing the glass panes and blocked Kanke Main Road, bringing traffic to a halt for an hour. The locals held the lackadaisical attitude of the hospital administration responsible for the incident.

A senior doctor of the hospital, Sambhu Prasad, could not be contacted for his comment. A police officer, however, quoted him as saying that the woman is sick and the allegations of the woman being drugged wil be confirmed after the medical report comes.

"We are investigating the matter and the charges are yet be proved," said Ranchi SSP Prabhat Kumar.

The girl was sent for medical examination on Thursday. "The accused has claimed that the woman has brought wrong allegations against him. He also claimed that he had not drugged the woman," said a police officer.
