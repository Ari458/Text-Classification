Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			Dismissing the plea of a man who killed his daughter after raping her in 2005, the Delhi High Court has upheld the rigorous imprisonment for life awarded to him by the trial court.

A division bench of Justice B.D. Ahmed and Justice Veena Birbal dismissed the appeal filed by Mangal Singh in an order made available Saturday and said that the circumstantial evidence led to inescapable conclusion that it was he who murdered his daughter after committing rape upon her. 

On the night of Oct 10, 2005 the neighbours heard Mangal Singh scream at his daughter and some of them even saw him carrying the victim on his shoulder in an unconscious state, the prosecution said. 

The court accepted the testimony of prosecution witnesses Rakesh and Kuldeep Kumar who told the court that Mangal Singh admitted before them that the girl was not his daughter and he strangled her.
