Description:
			A 14-year-old girl has alleged that she was raped by a youth she knew for six months in a moving car on EM Bypass before she found the courage to go to police. 

The prime accused, Rajdanga resident Dheeraj Chowdhury, has been arrested. He often works as a driver and police are looking for the car (or cars) in which the alleged rapes took place. 

The girl says that every time she was raped, there were two to three friends of Dheeraj watching and filming the horror. Two other suspects have also been nabbed but a fourth is on the run, say sources. 

According to senior officers of south suburban division, the girl had developed a friendship with Dheeraj. In the complaint filed on Thursday, she has alleged that in April, Dheeraj coaxed her to join him in a car for a joyride on EM Bypass. She was surprised to see three other men there. While one of them drove the car, Dheeraj raped her and the others watched, she says. 

After that, Dheeraj repeatedly blackmailed her into going with him for car rides where he kept raping her, said an investigator. On Thursday, she finally decided to fight back and went to police.

A medical test on her has been conducted. Though the final report is awaited, police said preliminary probe has found her complaint to be true. 

Police said they are trying to piece together the sequence of events. "Dheeraj claims he and the girl were in a relationship and she is taking revenge on him because he broke up with her. But not only is this claim false, even having physical relationship with a minor is rape," said an officer at the Lalbazar HQ. 

Police said that girl's statement is being recorded before a magistrate. "We will provide her counselling if required," said an officer.
