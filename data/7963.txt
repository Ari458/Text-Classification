Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			The police have arrested a youth who was accused of sexually abusing a 16-year-old speech impaired girl at her residence near Uppala in September.

Suresh, 30, a resident of Sharada Nagar, near Uppala, was rounded up from a hideout in neighbouring Karnataka by a Crime Branch team headed by Dy.SP. Premaraj on Monday.

The accused was brought here late this evening, the police said.

The incident occurred on September 22 when the youth forced his entry into the girl's residence when she was alone and sexually assaulted her after tying her up.

The case was first investigated by Circle Inspector P. V. Nirmala and later handed over to the Crime Branch following a complaint by the girl's family that the local police was moving slow in the case.
