Child Sexual Abuse, Rape, Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			A 9-year-old girl was allegedly raped by two compounders and a sweeper when she went to a local hospital complaining of stomach ache and constipation. 

The incident occurred on Wednesday. Local police, acting on a complaint from the girl's family, arrested the two compounders and sent them to jail. Their accomplice, a hospital sweeper, is still at large. 

The incident occurred in a private hospital. The victim's father said, "The girl was examined by the doctor who also owns the hospital, who instructed his staff to administer an enema to enable passage of stool. She was escorted inside the treatment room by three male attendants tasked with administering the enema." 

The father said it was surprising that the doctor did not feel the need to send a female attendant with the minor girl. Nor were family members allowed to be present during the process. 

The mother of the girl said the daughter came out of the room 45 minutes later, bleeding and writhing in pain. "We suspected something was amiss. In between, the three accused fled, leaving the bleeding girl behind." 

The girl's parents took her to the Civil Lines police station and lodged an FIR against the compounders, Khushnam and Raju, and the sweeper, whose identity could not be ascertained. The victim was taken to the district hospital, Rampur, where doctors confirmed rape. 

The girl is a resident of Imarta village under Azeem Nagar police station, Rampur, and comes from a family of daily-wage labourers. 

Investigating officer Firoz Khan told TOI, "The role of the doctor is also being investigated, given that the incident occurred within the hospital premises. We plan to charge the doctor under Section 120 B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC." 

The accused have already been charged under Section 376E (rape committed by hospital staff) of IPC and the Pocso Act.
