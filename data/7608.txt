Street Harassment
Description:
			Mukesh, Ravi and Shiva had reached Delhi by train and while waiting at a platform at New Delhi railway station, they could not resist passing a lewd comment at a woman. They thought they would get away with it but were caught by Delhi Police on Saturday. 

The railway police have launched a massive drive against miscreants who indulge in sexual harassment on platforms and on trains. 

Flying squads have been formed to apprehend men ogling at women and passing lewd comments. In the past two days, 68 people have been detained and 28 arrested for groping and indulging in other cognizable offences. The drive has been intensified in all local and express trains, including Rajdhani and Shatabdi trains. 

DCP Sanjay Bhatia said most of the people arrested were found ogling at women at the railway stations or touching them in crowded trains. 

Police officials said these miscreants would usually stand near the exit doors of trains and grope women while deboarding. Some of them were caught red-handed during the drive. 

Two men arrested during the drive were found to be taxi drivers waiting at the Nizamuddin Railway station for passengers. Police said most of them were not even aware of their crimes as they had been doing it for a long time. 

They were detained under Section 65 of the DP Act and were counselled by religious leaders and experts after this.
