Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			The police said a 14-year-old girl was allegedly repeatedly raped over the last few months by her brother-in-law (sister's husband). The matter came to light when the victim, who could not bear the ordeal anymore, confided in her sister, after which they approached the MIDC police station and registered an FIR.

"The victim was repeatedly raped by her brother-in-law; he had also threatened her of dire consequences if she told anyone about it. It was only when she finally told her sister that the matter came to light and we arrested the accused," said an officer.
