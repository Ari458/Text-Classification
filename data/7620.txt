Domestic Violence, Murder, Dowry Harassment
Description:
			A man and his parents have been arrested by the Ambattur police for dowry harassment leading to the death of his wife. 

Police said Priya, 27, was married to Prasad, 34, for four years, and the couple has a one year old son, Ajith. Prasad's parents, Palani and Pounammal, demanded gold and cash as dowry, and these were given at the time of marriage. 

They then began harassing Priya for more money from her father. Police said last week she had to be admitted to a private hospital in Saidapet after being beaten up by Prasad and his parents. On Sunday she died. 

Based on a complaint by her father Balaji, the Ambattur all-woman police arrested Prasad and his parents on charges of dowry harassment leading to death. The three were remanded in judicial custody on Monday. 

Neighbours told police that Priya was harassed by the family. She was sent to her house many times. Her parents tried to reason with Prasad's family but in vain.
