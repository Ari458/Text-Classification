Description:
			A student of a private school in Ranchi was found murdered on Friday after possibly being subjected to sexual abuse by one of his teachers, police said.

The seventh grader at Sapphire International School was found by some teachers at 1:30 am before he succumbed to injuries at a hospital later.

The CBSE affiliated residential-cum-day school is located 20 kms from Ranchi and has around 400 students, mostly from well-off families.
The police are investigating into every possible angle including a teacher's involvement in sexual harassment and murder. We have collected the evidences (that) prima facie suggest that boy might have been subjected to sexual abuse, said Hatia additional superintendent of police Prashant Anand.

Police recovered the undergarments of the student from the room of the suspect teacher.
The boy's father, a businessman at a village near Ranchi, alleged before media persons that his son resisted the teacher's sexual advances and was killed. Hang him or hand him over to me, he said.

In the first information report (FIR) lodged with the Tupudana police station earlier, the father had alleged that he found his son's body with a large injury marks on his face at the Rajendra Institute of Medical Science.

He said that school management informed him that his son had fever and sustained injury after he fell. The management also said that he would get well soon. However, when I reached RIMS I found my son dead on a stretcher, Mahto said.

School chairperson Rohit Sahu said that the institution was cooperating with the police. We have given the CCTV footage to the police to find out how the boy died, he said.
