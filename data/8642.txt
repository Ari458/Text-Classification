Domestic Violence, Murder, Dowry Harassment
Description:
			A woman from Abohar town of Fazilka, who was allegedly murdered, was cremated on Wednesday by her in-laws without informing her family members. The deceased has been identified as Dimple alias Deepika.

The deceased's family members have alleged that she was killed by her in-laws as they used to torture her for not bringing enough dowry. In his complaint to the police, Vicky Garg of Fazilka said his sister had married Rakesh Kumar in 2005 and soon after marriage Dimple was tortured for bringing insufficient dowry. Vicky further alleged that when his sister gave birth, the baby was forcefully taken away by her in-laws and given to Anil Kumar, her husband's elder brother.

In his police complaint Vicky has stated that his sister was often beaten up for not bringing enough dowry. "Dimple was murdered on Tuesday night and her in-laws did not even inform us about the tragedy. We were informed by someone from the neighbourhood regarding Dimple's death. We even called my sister's in-laws to request them to wait for us, but they cremated her in our absence. They didn't inform the police about Dimple's death nor was postmortem examination conducted to know the cause of death."

Abohar city additional station house officer Ved Prakash said police had begun investigation based on the statement of the victim's brother but no case had been registered yet. Vicky has demanded registration of a case of murder, destruction of evidence and criminal conspiracy against Dimple's husband and his family.
