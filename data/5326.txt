Molestation, Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			A 36-year-old security guard employed as a night guard at a multi-storeyed building on Ballygunge Circular Road was arrested on Monday for allegedly trying to rape a 21-year-old domestic help.

The accused, said police, had tried to strike up a friendship with the domestic help when she joined work about a month ago, but she refused his advances from the very first day.

About a week ago, the accused forced his way into her room while she was changing. But the woman raised a hue and cry and the accused fled.

The woman, a resident of Garia Police Para, in the southern fringes of the city, said she was afraid to go to the police all this while because he had threatened her that he would "terminate" her job if she dared to open her mouth.

It was only on Monday that she mustered the courage to complain to the police. The Karaya police arrested the accused and charged him with sections 354, 354A and 354B of the IPC. He has been sent to judicial custody.
