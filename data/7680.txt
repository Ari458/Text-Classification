Molestation, Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			A head constable of the Government Railway Police was arrested and suspended on Thursday after a vegetable vendor accused him of trying to touch her inappropriately in the ladies' coach of a CST-bound local late on Wednesday.

The complainant, a resident of Mumbra, claimed that head constable Simon Koli who was on duty inside the ladies compartment, demanded to see her ticket after she boarded the train at Diva at around 11.50pm. She alleged that he then tried to get close to her and touch her. As the train reached Mumbra station, the vendor, who was the lone commuter in the compartment, raised an alarm gathering a crowd. It is suspected that Koli, who had boarded the train at Khopoli, could be drunk, but the GRP has denied the claims.

Some passengers tried to pull Koli out of the bogie while others sprinted to the motorman's cabin demanding the train stop till the issue is resolved. GRP and Railway Protection Force personnel arrived and took the head constable to the police station with the vendor. "While the head constable claimed he was merely asking the hawker for a ticket, the woman alleged he tried to touch her. We have registered a case against him under section 354 of the IPC and arrested him on Thursday. We are investigating the case," informed DCP Rupali Ambure.
