Street Harassment
Description:
			A 24-year-old unemployed man allegedly caught the hand of a woman, flashed his private parts at her and hurled abuses in Andheri (west) late on Saturday night while she was on her way back home. Locals who heard her screams caught the man and handed him over to police before roughing him up.

According to the DN Nagar police, the incident took place at around 10 pm when the 34-year-old married woman was on her way back home in the Ganesh Nagar area. She was passing a public toilet near Abhishek Society bus stop on the New Versova Link Road in Andheri (west) when the alleged accused Devendra Natekar blocked her way. Natekar is a resident of a locality adjacent to Ganesh Nagar.

Natekar was under the influence of alcohol and didn't pay heed when she screamed asking for help. Before people rushed to the spot, Natekar lowered his pants and caught her hand demanding sex. He also hurled abuses at her. Local persons heard her screams and roughed up Natekar before handing him over to us. We are checking if he has a criminal background. We have applied all the stringent sections we could, said a police official.

The DN Nagar police has booked him under Section 354 A (sexual harassment), 509 (intentional intended to insult the modesty of a woman), 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace), 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation.) of the IPC. He was produced before a magistrate's court and has been remanded to police custody for a couple of days.

This year till date 1,089 cases of molestation have been registered and 903 detected, while last year in this period 884 cases were registered and 744 detected. The top officials of Mumbai police maintain that the steep rise is due to free and fair registration of crimes.
