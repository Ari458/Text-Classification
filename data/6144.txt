Description:
			Four tribal girl students of a municipality school at Amlapuram in East Godavari district were allegedly molested by a 52-year-old man for over six months, police said today.

The accused has been identified as Suryanarayana Reddy, a tailor.

"Suryanarayana, whose house is located near the premises of the elementary school, used to lure the girls by offering them chocolates and fruits and touch them inappropriately," said Amalapuram SP L Ankaiah.

He said three out of four girls (all 7-year-old) are students of class 3 and another girl (9-year-old) is a student of class 5.

A case has been registered against him under various sections of IPC and under the SC &ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, the SP said.
