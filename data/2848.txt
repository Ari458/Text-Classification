Description:
			As told by Pushpam's brother:

Twelve years ago, Pushpam got married to the Kumar Rai family in Bihar. Soon after her wedding, her husband and in-laws started demanding money as dowry.

On 11th May this year, as her five-year-old son watched, they brutally beat and murdered her because they did not get the money that they demanded. 

We immediately filed an FIR at the local police station. Shockingly, the police failed to take action and asked us to compromise if we wanted this case to go in our favour. The culprits have not been arrested yet. 

My nephew talks about his mother's death everyday. I want justice for my sister. But as a brother who couldn't do anything to save his sister, I also want to ensure that no woman ever suffers her plight in my district Begusarai in Bihar. 

Thats why I started a petition on Change.org telling the Begusarai Superintendent of Police (SP), Ms. Harpreet Kaur to immediately start an investigation into my sister's death so that the guilty can be punished.

As the SP, it is Ms. Kaur's duty to ensure that such acts of violence against women don't occur in Begusarai district again. 

Dowry has been a evil in our country for many years, but I want to end this practice in Begusarai and I can't do this without your support.

Please sign my petition and forward it to your friends and family. We need as much support as we can get to ensure justice for my sister Pushpam and to end the practice of dowry in Begusarai.
