Description:
			A 12-year-old girl from Puducherry was sexually abused by a 22-year-old autorickshaw driver in Auroville. 

A senior official at the CWC said the crime came to light when the girl was taken to JIPMER for missed periods. “The test results showed that she was pregnant,” added the official.
