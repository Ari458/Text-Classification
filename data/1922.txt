			The Juhu police have launched a manhunt for an unidentified person for allegedly molesting and attempting to kidnap a 13-year-old girl in Juhu.

The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon, when the victim was returning home after attending tuitions.

According to police, the victim, who is a class 8 student of a Juhu-based school, was returning home along with her friend after her tuition class ended, at around 4pm. After her friend parted ways with her to go to her own house, the girl was left alone. This was when a stranger approached her and asked her to accompany him to his office nearby, claiming he wanted to hand over a number to her father.

The girl told the accused that he could cal her father and give him the number over the phone, but he convinced her that his office was just in the next building. He then took her into a nearby building, and while going up the stairs, he allegedly molested her. After reaching the first floor, he said the office had shut for the day without him knowing, said inspector Vijay Khaire. He then asked the victim to go to another building.
