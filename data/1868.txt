Dowry Harassment
Description:
			A man allegedly threw his wife into a well demanding more dowry in Jajpur district, police said.

However, the woman survived as she was promptly rescued by neighbours at Nuagaon village in the district on Tuesday.

The couple had been married for two years and the husband pressing for more dowry had subjected the 25-year-old woman to mental and physical torture, the police said.

To escape torture, the woman was living at her parents house along with her husband. However, she was assaulted again on Tuesday and when she objected, her husband allegedly threw her into the well in the courtyard and assaulted his mother-in-law injuring her critically, the police said.
