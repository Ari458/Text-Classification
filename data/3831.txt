Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A teacher of a government school in Shillai area of Sirmaur district was booked for allegedly raping a 14-year-old student.

A case was registered against the teacher under section 376 of IPC (rape) and relevant section of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO), after recording statement of the victim who belongs to Dakkar village.

The parents of the victim, studying in the government school in Kyari in Shillai, alleged that they had lodged the complaint but police did not register a case.

It was after parents of the girls studying in the school staged a protest that the Sirmaur police registered a case of sexual assault against the teacher.

Parents of half a dozen girl students have also alleged molestation of their daughters by the teacher.

An emergency meeting of the school's management committee (SMC) was convened in which agitated parents demanded stringent action against him.

The school headmaster made on the spot inquiries from students and staff members, following which a strongly worded resolution was passed and sent to the education department for immediate action against the teacher.

Aggrieved parents of the victim also filed a complaint with the Shillai police and pressed for registering an FIR in this matter.
