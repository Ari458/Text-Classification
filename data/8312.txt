Molestation, Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			The policeman, who had allegedly molested several girls and women during a recently-held festival in the city, has been arrested and suspended from duty, police said today.

A video clip purportedly showing the policeman groping girls and inappropriately touching women at Kankaria Carnival held between December 25 and 31, had gone viral on social media, including Whatsapp, following which the city police had launched a search to nab him.

The accused, identified as Ramsinh Valvai (48), a Head Constable attached with Danilimda police station here, was arrested last night after three days of extensive search operation by several police teams.

"Valvai was part of the police team deployed at Kankaria Carnival on bandobast duty, where the incident took place. He was suspended from duty today and we would produce him before court in due course," Maninagar police inspector N S Desai said.

He has been charged under IPC section 354 (outraging modesty of women), 354A (sexual harassment) and 268 (public nuisance).

There was a challenge before the police to identify the accused as his face was not properly visible in the video clip. The footage had been shot from behind the accused and city police had formed several teams for his identification.

"The teams went through all the available CCTV footage and scanned the clip several times to get an idea about his face. We then checked names of all those who were given duties in that part of the venue and zeroed-in on Valvai," said Desai.

In his defence, Valvai claimed that he was just trying to make his way through the crowd.

"After his arrest, Valvai claimed that he had no intention of touch the women, as he was just trying to go through the bustling crowd," Desai said.
