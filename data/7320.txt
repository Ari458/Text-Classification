Murder
Description:
			A woman accused in a murder case was killed while her husband sustained injuries when their relative attacked them with a lethal weapon at Putlibowli early on Tuesday.

The woman Sonu Bai (35) lived along with her husband Anand Das (42), who is a temple priest in the compound of Laxminarayana temple at Rangmahal cross roads in Putlibowli. On Tuesday, while the woman was doing household chores her relative Lakhan barged into the house and inflicted wounds with a dagger on Sonu Bai. Her husband Anand Das, who came to her rescue was also attacked, Inspector Sultan Bazaar, P Shiv Shankar Rao said.

While the woman died on the spot, her husband was rushed to a private hospital for treatment. The police has reportedly taken Lakhan into custody and is being interrogated.

Police investigation revealed that Sonu Bai allegedly masterminded the murder of her cousin Tuljaram in 2009 after the latter killed her brother Narsingh Dass in Nanded district of adjoining Maharashtra. Sonu Bai was arrested by the police in that case in 2010.

Police said that Sonu Bais killing could be in retaliation to the murder of Tuljaram as the accused Lakhan was his relative.
