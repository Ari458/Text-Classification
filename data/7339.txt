Rape, Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			A 25-year-old woman was allegedly gang-raped by an auto driver and three others on Tuesday night. An FIR was lodged at the Badshapur police station on Thursday.

The Shikohpur resident boarded a shared auto from Rajeev Chowk at 9 pm after finishing work at a factory. There were three passengers in the auto.

When the auto reached Hero Honda Chowk, the driver turned into the service lane.

When she protested, the driver said he needed fuel and was going to a petrol pump. Instead he took her to a deserted spot on the DLF road ahead of Haldiram where the men raped her. They then dumped the woman on the spot and left.

The woman managed to reach the main road and make her way home. On Wednesday night she filed a police complaint and medical examinations confirmed that she was raped.

"We have lodged the case against the auto driver and three men under section 376D (gang rape). They will be arrested soon," said Badshahpur police station SHO Praveen Malik.
