Abuse
Description:
			A 12-year-old girl, currently residing at a child shelter in the city's Gandhi Nagar area, shocked the shelter home authorities with a story of sexual abuse by her own relatives.

She alleged that two distant relatives repeatedly raped her forcing her to escape from her home in Galta Gate area a year ago. Cops spotted the stranded girl and asked her about her parents, but she was so scared that she feigned ignorance despite knowing her address.

The cops handed her over to the shelter home authorities. After remaining mum for a year, she finally mustered courage and told the authorities about what she went through. They then lodged an FIR with Galta Gate police station. One of the accused has been taken into custody.

The girl is a resident of Etawa in Uttar Pradesh. Her stepmother's uncle had raped her. The family then moved to Galta Gate area. She then told her another distant relative about the incident.

However, this relative too, instead of reporting it to the police, raped her. The girl fled from her house because she did not want to tell her parents about the sexual abuse and there was no one else she could turn to for help. A police team at Galta Gate spotted her. She told them that she had got lost. When they asked about her parents, she feigned ignorance.

The police then handed her over to Gandhi Nagar child shelter home.

"During a counselling with shelter home authorities on Sunday, the girl revealed that she had been raped by her of two relatives. The shelter home superintendent lodged an FIR," said a police officer.
