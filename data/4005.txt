Murder, Dowry Harassment
Description:
			Tangra police arrested three persons from Gobinda Khatik Road for allegedly torturing an 18-year-old newly married woman in the name of dowry that led to her death.

The victim's father has alleged that her in-laws had set her on fire on January 26 after she expressed her inability to pay up.

Kajal Mallick, originally hailing from Samastipur in Bihar, succumbed on Tuesday at NRS Hospital after suffering 80% burns.

According to the police, Kajal was found in flames on Sunday night. "The in-laws initially claimed that she had tried to commit suicide. However, when we contacted Kajal's father Bijoy Mullick, who resides in Samastipur, he told us how his daughter had informed him about dowry harassment.

Based on his complaint, we registered a case of murder and dowry harassment against the accused and arrested three from her in-law's family. These include her husband Pradip Mullick, father-in-law Sonelal Mullick and brother-in-law Rajendra Mullick," said an investigating officer.

The cops have begun a manhunt for a fourth accused who is said to be absconding presently. A proper magisterial inquiry has also been ordered. The girl's postmortem was conducted and later handed over to her father.
