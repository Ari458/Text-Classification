Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A 26-year-old Bhandup resident was arrested on Thursday for allegedly forcing himself on his teenage sister. The matter came to light when the wife of the accused approached the Bhandup police station and complained against him.

According to the Bhandup police, the 14-year-old victim told the police that she was alone at home on Monday when her elder brother raped her. She said he also threatened her with dire consequences if she ever told anyone about it.

The standard VIII student was traumatised, and kept quiet for two days. However, on Wednesday, she narrated the entire incident to her sister-in-law. The sister-in-law immediately approached the Bhandup police with the victim and lodged a complaint against her husband.

"The girl had lost her parents a few years back and since then, her brother has been taking care of her. On Monday, her brother allegedly forced himself on her. We have launched a manhunt for the accused," said Sunil Shejwal, assistant commissioner of police (Bhandup division).

"We have recorded the statement of the victim and are carrying out further preliminary inquiries. We are also investigating if she was sexually assaulted by the accused on previous occasions," said ACP Shejwal.

The Bhandup police have registered a case of rape under the Indian Penal Code as well as under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO).
