Description:
			The sessions court here on Friday sentenced a man to death for rape and murder of a two-year-old girl.

Additional District and Sessions judge A C Chaphale sentenced Shatrughan Baban Mashram (21) to death on two counts (for murder under section 302 of IPC and for fatal injuries inflicted during a rape which may cause death under a sub-section of section 376).

The incident had taken place at Jatala village in Ghataji tehsil of Yavatmal district of Maharashtra on February 11,2013.

According to the police, Mashram told the victim, who was playing outside a temple where a community feast had been organized, that her father had asked her to return home and she should come with him.

He took her to an under-construction school building where he raped her. The girl's body was later found by the parents; she had ten bite marks on her body with the flesh bitten off in some places.

Mashram was subsequently arrested.

Public prosecutor P V Gadbaile demanded death sentence for the accused, considering the brutality of the crime.

The court upheld his argument that it was a crime of the rarest of rare category case and awarded Mashram death penalty.
