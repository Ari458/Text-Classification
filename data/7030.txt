Murder, Dowry Harassment
Description:
			A 26-year-old woman was allegedly set ablaze by her in-laws in Chahata village under Dharmasala police limits in the district on Tuesday. The woman, Suchismita Nayak of Saika village under Barchana police limits, was killed as her parents could not meet the demand of Rs two lakh made by her in-laws.

Police said Suchismita was married to Prashant Nayak of Chahata, a businessman, three years back. During marriage, her parents had given cash of Rs 2.2 lakh, 250 grams of gold and other household articles as dowry to the groom's family. Soon after marriage, Prashant, his brother and parents started torturing Suchismita for more dowry of Rs two lakh. After one year of marriage, Suchismita's father Surendra Kumar Rout gave Prashant the money in four installments.

Last year, the couple had a baby girl and on her 21st day ceremony, Surendra paid another Rs one lakh to Prashant as per his family demand.

In an FIR against Prashant, his brother Geda, father Bishnu Charan and mother Sandhyarani, Surendra alleged that even after taking Rs 5.2 lakh from him, the four used to torture his daughter demanding another Rs two lakh as she had given birth to a girl child. This time, though, he expressed his inability to pay them further.

On Tuesday at about 4 pm, we got a call from Prashant's family members and they asked us to come to their house. When we reached, their house was locked from outside, he stated in the FIR.

Surendra said a neighbour of Prashant informed that they had taken Suchismita to the Government Hospital at Dharmasala. When we reached there, we found Suchismita's burnt body in a plastic sack on the verandah of the hospital and neither her husband nor in-laws were present there, he said.

Police said a case of dowry death has been registered against the four accused, who are now absconding. Efforts are on to nab them.
