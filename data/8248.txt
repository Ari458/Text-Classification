Description:
			The factional feud between Sonamukhi MLA Dipali Saha and local Trinamool-run municipality chairman Surajit Mukhopadhyay came to the fore on Wednesday when the chairman led a 150-strong crowd to gherao Sonamukhi police station demanding arrest of culprits who allegedly assaulted a pregnant woman and two of her women relatives.

The pregnant woman fell unconscious after a group of men and women barged into her house on Sunday and allegedly assaulted the trio at Bankura's Sonamukhi. The alleged attack was reportedly the outcome of factional feud between Saha and Mukhopadhyay. The attacker's target was the victim's brother Nissar Ali Ansari, who belongs to the chairman's group. Ali alleged the 15-strong group was led by Putul Gorai, a Saha follower.

After lodging a complaint after the attack, he and the chairman's group gave cops 72 hours to arrest the attackers. With no arrests even then, the group gheraoed the police station.
Mukhopadhyay said, "Members of the minority community were made targets of the attack. I can't accept this as a people's representative. Police must arrest the culprits. There is no allegation against the family. We have given them another 72 hours. If the culprits aren't arrested, I will hit the streets."
