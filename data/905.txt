Description:
			Nidhi Agnihotri was reportedly harassed because she had failed to fulfil the demands of her husband Dharmendra Pathak and in-laws. 

Her husband and in-laws recently asked her to bring Rs 3 lakh in cash. At the time of her wedding, Nidhi's parents, who hail from Hanspuram in Naubasta, gave dowry worth lakhs, including cash and valuables to Dharmendra Pathak, son of Rajesh Pathak, a resident of Deen Dayalpuram in Naubasta. The victim alleged that her in-laws have been harassing her to bring more dowry. Recently, when she turned down the demands, they threw her out of the house.
