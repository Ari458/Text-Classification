Murder
Description:
			A woman was murdered by her son-in-law in Tenali town on Tuesday. The accused surrendered to the police after the incident. The victim, K Nagendram (40), of Suddapallivaripalem village of Duggirala mandal, went to the vegetable market in Tenali town along with her daughter Shravani. After shopping, they went to a hotel for breakfast when Naga Raju, Nagendram's son-in-law, reached the spot and attacked the duo with a sickle. While Shravani escaped unhurt, Nagendram died on the spot.

Naga Raju, a daily wager, married Shravani three years ago but she deserted him a few months later. He reportedly developed grouse against Nagendram as he was not allowing Shravani to live with him. As his repeated pleas to send Shravani with him went unheeded, Naga Raju decided to eliminate Nagendram and hacked her to death on Tuesday.

He later surrendered before the police. Police visited the spot and recovered the weapon and shifted the body for autopsy.
