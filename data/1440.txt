Rape, Abuse
Description:
			Already in shock after being allegedly raped by five men in West Bengal's Birbhum district, a tribal woman is now facing the wrath of her entire village. The victim, a construction worker, was allegedly raped on February 26 while she was returning home after work. Since then, her village has been pressurising her to leave.


1. The villagers have warned her that she will be paraded naked if she doesn't pack up and leave. They have also fined her Rs. 12,000 and seized her cows. 
 
2. "They are telling me to commit suicide, want me to hang myself or to drink poison. 

3. "Everyone is threatening me and beating me. Today morning the villagers came and broke the door of the house." 

4. "They warned me to leave the place or else they will make me walk naked. I am scared and don't know what to do," said the victim.
 
Villagers, however, are determined the woman should be punished.
 
"Women who do illegal work are punished by the villagers and the village head. The punishments are of different patterns that might be penalty or maybe she should be thrown out from the village. She has to be punished for her crime. In our society, we punish this kind of woman and she had to be punished for this crime. These are our rules and laws and we always follow them," said Shyam Bera, the village head.
