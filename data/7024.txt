Rape
Description:
			Police are on the lookout for a 29-year-old man who is suspected to have raped a mentally ill 20-year-old woman on Tuesday evening. The woman was staying with her aunt at New Washermetpet, to undergo treatment for mental illness. 

The aunt called police after she saw the man, a neighbour, raping the woman after locking her up in a room on a terrace. Police said Pradeep, the suspect, has been working at an eatery in the neighbourhood, and was living in a one-room bachelor accommodation in the neighbourhood. 

Investigating officials said that Pradeep lured the girl to the terrace on Tuesday evening around 5pm. When the woman's aunt walked onto the terrace a little later, she was shocked. Pradeep jumped out of the terrace and fled. Wrapping the mentally ill woman with a cloth, the aunt raised an alarm. Neighbours, who heard her call, attempted to chase the man who managed to escape. 

The woman was sent to Government Stanley College Hospital for medical examination. 

The incident caused tension in the locality. Neighbours were shocked and the incident became the talk of the day as Pradeep was well-known in the neighbourhood. The aunt lodged a complaint with police, who booked the 29-year-old man on charges of rape. 

A senior police official investigating the case said that the complainant would be made an eyewitness in the case. Police are trying to locate Pradeep by tracking his mobile phone. "Based on the mobile tower location, we should be able to nab him in a day or two," the police official said.
