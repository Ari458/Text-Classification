Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A nine-year-old girl, whose father is a KMC employee, was raped at her own house in central Kolkata. The accused, identified as Asim Hazra (29), lives in the same building. Hazra was employed at a nursing home on Palm Avenue.

Hazra lived in a one-room 'barsati' on the balcony of the house. The girl, a Class I student whose parents were not at home, climbed up to the balcony around 1.30pm. The accused allegedly lured her to his room, offering her "unlimited time" to watch television.

After confining her in the room, the accused raped her and threatened her against protesting. The girl returned home in the evening and fell sick. When her mother enquired, she initially refused to open up. However, she began to bleed and her mother rushed her to the hospital. It was then that her parents realized that she was raped.

The complainants then came to New Market police station and registered a complaint. A case under Section 376 (rape) IPC has been registered. A raid was carried out at the nursing home and the accused arrested. Police have completed the girl's medical test. They will carry out a forensic examination of the spot at the earliest.

Joint CP (crime) Pallab Kanti Ghosh confirmed the incident and said other legal sections might also be slapped on the accused at the time of filing the chargesheet.
