Description:
			More than two weeks have gone by and the victim Rao has no idea who the man was, or his motive. she was driving past Ackruti Star in Andheri MIDC, when the traffic lights turned red. 

When the lights turned green, the biker refused to give way. Incessant honking from other vehicles forced him to move, but not before he kicked my car, and on being asked why, he punched the victim.

Then he hit her with his helmet, and when she rolled up her window shield, he smashed the car's front glass with his helmet. That's when she decided to fight back. I lost all fear and confronted him, she said. Grabbing his motorbike handle, she screamed for help. I am sure he was drunk; and later, someone in the crowd pointed to a sticker on his motorbike that suggested he was a policeman. Realising I won't let go of his motorbike, he ran away leaving it behind, she said.
