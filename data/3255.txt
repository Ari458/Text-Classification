Description:
			In a joint operation, Labour Department and Police rescued a minor girl working as domestic help at a house in a posh locality in Ambala city.

The girl was employed in the house through a recruiting agency around one and half year back and her health condition is not good.

Child Protection Officer Mega Singla told reporters that she received information from one of the residents of Sector 7 about the poor physical condition of the domestic help working in the house of Sandeep Kumar.

When the team raided the house the girl was sleeping on the floor in the balcony of the house.

Whenever the owner of the house went somewhere along with his family member the maid was left in the back corridor of the house all alone and was allegedly not provided proper food due to which she was pale and weak.

The girl seemed to be around 13-years old but in the recruitment agency's records her age was shown 20 years and her name was also different.

The house owner, Sandeep, however, refuted the allegation of the maid, saying the girl was engaged through a proper recruitment agency and there was no ill-treatment meted out to her.
