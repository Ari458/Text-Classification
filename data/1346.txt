Description:
			The couple, a resident of Birajpur village, had come to Suri for the woman's treatment. On Friday, after they failed to get a bus back home, they decided to lodge at a hotel near Suri bus stand. They alleged that a gang of youths posing as CID officers allegedly barged into the room late on Friday night. When the husband opened the door, they asked for the wife. The woman was in the bathroom. No sooner did she come out than a youth allegedly pounced on her and molested her.

The husband alleged that he was beaten by the goons. According to their complaint, the miscreants threatened the couple by naming an influential local political leader. They had earlier tried to lodge a police complaint but was prevented by the political leader's men.
