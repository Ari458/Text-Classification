Description:
			A dispute over a piece of land in Basma village resulted in a married woman being in a critical condition, after she was set on fire by her warring relatives on Monday night. 

As per information, one Gurbachan Singh had an old dispute with his brother Gurnam Singh over the ownership of a piece of land in their village, Basma, about 30 km from Patiala. Local residents had tried many times to settle the dispute, but had failed to resolve the issue. While Gurnam and his family members wanted to take possession of the entire plot, Gurbachan was offering only Gurnam's share of the plot to his family.

Police have registered a case under section 307 of the IPC against the six accused including Gurnam Singh and his wife Surinder Kaur, besides her four brothers, but no arrest had been made till the filing of this report.
