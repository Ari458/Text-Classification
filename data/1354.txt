Description:
			72 sex workers, including 17 minors, were rescued from G B Road by the Andhra Pradesh Police in a joint operation with the Delhi Police after receiving information from a 19-year-old girl who had managed to escape from one of the brothels and return to her home town in Andhra Pradesh. 

"Most of the women confessed that they had eloped with their lovers and wanted to marry them. However, they were sold to brothels in the city. Shockingly, we noticed that almost 80 per cent of the women had eloped with men named 'Raju' which hints at a deep-rooted nexus between pimps across the country," said Subir Roy, director programmes at Shakti Vahani.
