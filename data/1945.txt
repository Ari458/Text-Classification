Rape
Description:
			A 50-year-old Pir was arrested in Mattan area of this south Kashmir district for allegedly raping a minor daughter of one of his followers, Police said Thursday.
Police said the girl, according to doctors, was eight months pregnant and was expected to deliver the baby in February, after which a DNA analysis will be done to ascertain the facts.

The Pir identified as Muhammad Yousuf Bhat of Utteresoo Shangus was presently residing at Tulla Haar Aishmuqam.

He has married thrice and has half a dozen children with some grand-children too.
He used to frequent victim's house on the pretext of providing the household benefits of his spiritual powers.

He visited many households in the area and had a large number of followers including the victim's parents, said Ramesh Kumar Jalla, SSP Anantnag.

He said some nine months back the accused visited the victim's house and found her alone there, after which he allegedly raped her.

The girl complained to her mother about the incident. However, her parents were not ready to accept the fact given their faith in Pir and his spiritual powers, police said. After the girl complained of some abnormalities, her family took her to the same Pir again.
Police said he assured the parents that everything was alright and threatened the girl of dire consequences if she opened her mouth again.
However, things got clearer when the girl complained about the abnormal size of her belly and was taken to a doctor where an ultrasound revealed that she was eight months pregnant.
