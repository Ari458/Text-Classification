Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A 21-year-old man was arrested on charges of raping a minor girl in the Union territory of Puducherry on Thursday. His friend was also arrested for assisting him in committing the crime. 

The arrested were identified as V Arumugam alias Kuppan, 21, a lorry driver from Reddiarpalayam and K Vignesh, 28 from Krishna Nagar, the owner of a lorry. Police said Arumugam and Vignesh approached the 16-year-old victim when she was alone at her house around 6pm on April 17. They told her that they were looking for a house in the neighbourhood and asked her details and phone numbers of her people who had vacated their houses recently. The girl told them that she did not have any information and attempted to lock the door. 

However, Arumugam managed to push his way inside the house. He overpowered her and punched her on the face. He switched on the television and kept the volume high so that neighbours could not hear her screams for help. He raped her while Vignesh stood guard in front of the house. The driver left after she fainted. Her mother and sisters reached the house within a few minutes. She narrated the incident to them. They alerted Childline, which referred the case to child welfare committee. 

The committee lodged a complaint with D Nagar police, who booked Arumugam under Section 6 (punishment for aggravated penetrative sexual assault) and Section 17 (punishment for abetment) of the protection of children from sexual offenses act (Pocso) and arrested them. 

Police produced them before a local court that remanded them to judicial custody.
