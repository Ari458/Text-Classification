Description:
			Two days after the 5-year-old girl Shivani Vishwakarma went missing from Digha, the Rabale MIDC police have recovered her decomposed dead body found floating in the trench some 200 metres away from her house in Yadav Nagar. 

The Rabale MIDC police claims that the minor girl must have fallen in the deep trench while playing near the trench which was camouflaged with hyacinth. 

Senior police inspector Ram Deshmukh said, "The girl's dead body has been sent for post mortem to ascertain whether she has been sexually assaulted. Prima facie, the doctors at the civic hospital have ruled out sexual assault. As of now, we have still registered a kidnapping case and if civic doctors give a report of cause of death as due to drowning, then we will register an accidental death case and if it is confirmed that she was sexually assaulted, then the relevant sections under IPC and POCSO Act will be applied." 

Inspector Deshmukh further said, "The trench in the Yadav nagar is surrounded by the slums and the local children play in the vicinity. But, due to the hyacinth forming a layer above the trench filled with rainwater, the minor girl must have assumed it as green grass and went to play on it, when she fell into the trench which is 5-6 feet deep. Thus, causing her death due to drowning. Some local residents The girl's corpse was spotted floating on the water-filled trench by some local residents who had gone near trench to answer nature's call as even unbearable stench was emanating from the trench due to the decomposed dead body. As of now, any foul play has been ruled out till the post mortem report is obtained. The civic hospital has however preserved the viscera sample to forensic laboratory testing."
