Rape
Description:
			The sessions court convicted a driver for outraging the modesty of a 14-year-old
girl and sentenced him to two years of imprisonment.
	
However, he was acquitted of the rape charge levelled against him.
	
According to the Nagpada police, the accused, Shadab Hussain was a resident of Mumbai Central in suburban Mumbai and the victim was his neighbour.
	
Allegedly, in February last year, he took the victim to his friend's house in Naigoan area and raped her. At this time, the victim did not tell her mother about the
incident.
	
When Hussain called the victim to his friend's house in Naigaon once again, she refused to go initially, but went along later, after he promised that he would not do anything against her wishes.
	
When he allegedly raped the victim despite his promise, the girl narrated the incident to her mother and a case was filed at the Nagpada police station.
	
The police had arrested Hussain in February 2012, who has been in custody since, after being booked for rape and kidnapping, besides inducing, abducting and forcible marriage.
