Domestic Violence, Dowry Harassment
Description:
			A 22-year-old woman on Sunday threatened to immolate herself in front of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister's residence if action is not taken against six persons, including her husband and mother-in-law, accused of harassing her for dowry. Sheeba wrote to the Chief Minister claiming that she will immolate herself if action is not taken against the six accused, including her husband Javed and her mother-in-law Nanda Begum, and also alleged that the police are complicit with the accused.

According to the woman, she had married Javed in March 2013 and soon he and his family started harassing her for dowry. On September 13, Javed allegedly attacked her using a sharp-edged weapon. Later she managed to reach her paternal house, following which a case was registered with the police. Sheeba said a case was lodged against the accused under IPC section 498A (cruelty), 323 (causing hurt), (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) 307 (attempt to murder). She claimed that the accused, who allegedly have the support of some local ministers, are pressuring her to withdraw the case and have also threatened to kill her. Rejecting the woman's allegations, police incharge Alka Singh today said the case under investigation and only after the inquiry is complete will the arrests be made.
