Abuse
Description:
			Aditya and Reshma, residents of Tardeo, met while doing an ITI course. They fell in love and their families agreed to their marriage.

When Aditya allegedly assaulted Reshma, she refused to marry him as he was unemployed, doubted her character and used to assault her.

The police said that on Saturday Aditya took her to a nearby ground and allegedly assaulted her. At 9pm, Reshma's brother got a call from his friend, telling him that Reshma had met with an accident when she was with Aditya on his bike. When the family rushed to GT Hospital, it got to know that Reshma was dead, the officer said. Reshma's family inquired at the accident spot and learnt that no accident had taken place. Instead, Reshma had jumped off a railway foot overbridge.
