Child Sexual Abuse, Rape, Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			The Rajasthan State Women's Commission probing allegations of sexual assault on girl students of Bansathali University has found the varsity officials guilty of suppressing facts about two incidents of molestation.

In its report submitted to Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Sunday, the panel pointed out that between August and September, around 213 girls have left the university in the middle of the course.

Two students were reportedly manhandled on September 13 evening. It was reported to the hostel warden Lalita Rautela in writing. But no action was taken for 19 days. Even the vice chancellor Adiya Shastri was not informed, the report stated.

On October 4, students held a massive demonstration on the campus in Niwai. The very next day the local police arrested the warden for locking up the girls and the ambulance driver for molesting a girl.

Laad Kumari Jain, chairperson of the panel, said the commission is trying to contact the students who left the varsity. The panel is also preparing a questionnaire for them to ascertain the reasons behind them leaving Banasthali.

The panel head also accused that the university officials refused to disclose the names and addresses of these students and it had to use its judicial powers.

The report also pointed out that majority of the top posts in the university are being held by members of a single family. Jain said the university is guilty of tampering evidence and misrepresenting facts. The report blamed the local police for hushing up the matter and diluting the case against the two arrested by invoking on them weaker sections of law.

Students protesting on the campus had also raised the issue of a rape case but the panel probing the allegations has not been able to ascertain the charges as none of the girls who alleged rape were ready for the medical test.
