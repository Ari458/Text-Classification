Description:
			A woman athlete staying at the Sports Authority of India (SAI) hostel here has brought allegations of sexual harassment against her coach.

In a complaint lodged at the Mahila police station on Wednesday, the 17-year-old said the coach, Sushant Roy, had been physically and sexually harassing her for the past few months.

"I sent my daughter to SAI hostel in July. She had earlier told us about the coach's inappropriate behaviour. We didn't take it seriously. On Wednesday, she called us up and said Roy had beaten her up. She wanted us to take her home," said the woman's father.

The coach refuted the allegations. "I have never harassed any player," he said. He, however, accepted that he had slapped the girl on Wednesday morning after he found her quarrelling with some players.

"The girl was sent for medical examination and we have also recorded her statement. The coach was called to the police station for interrogation," said ACP Sitaram Satpathy.
