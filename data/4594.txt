			A 17-year-old Bru girl was gang raped at Kanchanpur in North Tripura district on Friday afternoon.

On Saturday, police arrested Mahendra Chakma and Sujit Chakma and a local court sent them to five days' police custody.

The girl, a resident of Mizoram's Mamit district, was staying at her sister's house in Kanchanpur. On Friday afternoon, while returning from the local market, she was allegedly picked up by the accused in a car and raped in a nearby forest. She was abandoned near her sister's house at night.

The 16-year-old victim, a student of Class VI, had gone missing while returning from school. She was found dead in a forest less than 100 metres from her home with several injury marks on her body.
