Child Sexual Abuse, Crime, Rape
Description:
			A case of child sexual assault and possible child marriage has emerged from Puducherry in which the accused was a student of the Pondicherry Engineering College.

According to details available with the Child Welfare Committee (CWC), the accused, 20-year-old Nagurbabu, a native of Yanam was staying as a paying guest in Rainbow Nagar. Following an affair, the victim, a minor, aged 17, became pregnant. A ‘marriage’ was said to have been conducted in a temple in Puducherry, and the victim gave birth to a baby girl in February this year.

A month after the ‘marriage’ though, the accused absconded. The victim and her mother then approached former Chief Judge of Puducherry, P. Velmurugan, who sent them to the CWC seeking a report. The CWC then filed a complaint with the Grand Bazaar police station, said CWC chairperson Vidyaa Ramkumar.

A case has been filed under Sections 4 and 6 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, said Inspector Chinta Kodandaram of Grand Bazaar police station. He added that charges about child marriage would also be investigated. The victim has been provided counselling. Ms. Ramkumar said that the victim faces an uncertain future as she has dropped out of school, and is unwilling to give up the baby for adoption.
