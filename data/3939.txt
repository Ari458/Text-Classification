Abduction, Rape
Description:
			A 19-year-old call center employee was allegedly gang-raped by two boys, one of them being a minor, at a marriage garden-cum-restaurant on MR-10 road here on Sunday evening.

The matter was reported by the girl's family at MIG police station on the intervening night of Sunday and Monday. According to MIG police station in charge Kamal Jain, a case has been lodged against three boys, Hitendra, Nitin aged between 19 and 20 years and their teenaged friend under Section 363 (abduction), 3762D (gang rape) and 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 34 (crime with a common intent), but no arrests have been made so far. Importantly, the restaurant is owned by ruling BJP corporator Harishankar Patel's family. The corporator, however, denied it saying the restaurant has been rented out by his brother Chandra Shekhar Patel to someone.

The survivor, a resident of Sarvahara Nagar, alleged that two boys, including ex-boyfriend Nitin and his teenaged friend (both her neighbours) on Sunday evening, inquired about her whereabouts over the phone and asked her to drop her home on their two-wheeler. Following her consent, the duo picked her up from LIG crossing (the place where the girl was then), but instead of dropping her home, they took her to the restaurant, where another friend Hitendra joined them.

The duo booked one of the private cabins at the restaurant by shelling out Rs 100-150 for an hour, where Hitendra and his teenaged friend allegedly raped the girl. Later, Nitin also tried to rape her but failed due to resistance by the girl.

The girl somehow managed to reach her house and narrated the matter to her mother, following which, the matter was reported to the police. "We're investigating the case and the three accused will be arrested soon," MIG police station in charge added.
