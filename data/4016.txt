Crime, Rape
Description:
			A 38-year-old Japanese woman lodged a complaint with Anjuna police that she was raped and sexually assaulted by a Kashmiri man in Kashmir.

While she was in Kashmir, in August 2013, she met the man who got friendly with her. He asked the woman for 20,000 promising that he would take her trekking. She said that the man did not take her trekking nor did he return her money and instead sexually assaulted her.

She was frightened and felt unsafe to lodge the complaint in Kashmir. As it is a crime against a woman we have registered the complaint, done zero registration and will forward it to Kashmir police for further probe.

In January 2013, Delhi police announced that 'zero first information reports' (FIRs) may be booked on the basis of a woman's statement at any police station irrespective of jurisdiction. Women can lodge a FIR at any police station and it has to be registered on the basis of the woman's complaint verbatim.
