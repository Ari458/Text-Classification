Dowry Harassment
Description:
			A team of Haryana police left for Panchkula to arrest a former follower of Sirsa based Dera Sacha Sauda, Vishwas Gupta, following his wife Hanipreet Insan's complaint regarding dowry harassment against him and his father and mother for harassment for dowry and attempt to murder.

Hanipreet was married to Vishwas Gupta on February 14, 1999, at Sirsa. "On the same day, Gupta and his parents demanded Rs 2 lakh cash, a Tata Safari car and other dowry items from my parents, and threatened to break the marriage if their demands were not met," she alleged.

"Unable to afford the car, my father gave them Rs 2 lakh and 50 'tolas' of gold. This failed to suffice my in-laws' greed and they kept harassing, taunting and beating me every day," said Hanipreet, adding, "even on festivals like Diwali and Holi."

She said her father Ramanand Taneja called several panchayats to resolve her woes. "But, my in-laws pleaded guilty and promised to discontinue torturing me for dowry each time," Hanipreet added.
