Foeticide/Infanticide
Description:
			Four female foetuses were found in a drain on Kurnool bus stand road causing a flutter among the people on Tuesday. Municipal sanitary workers, who were cleaning the drain, found the foetuses and alerted the police.

The II Town police took possession of the foetuses and launched an investigation.

Local people said that the foetuses might have been dumped there after performing abortions, as there were several private hospitals in the vicinity.

The foetuses found in the drain were aged around five months, Kurnool District Medical and Health Officer Sarada said. An inquiry would be conducted to find out if it was a case of female foeticide, Dr. Sarada said. She said action would be taken against private hospitals if it was established that they performed abortions to get rid of the female infants. She said the foetuses could have been dumped in the drain by staff of private hospitals after performing abortions.
