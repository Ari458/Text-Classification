Description:
			The Victim Shilpa Nanaware (22) has accused her husband and in-laws of torturing her and demanding Rs 2 lakh from her father as dowry.
At the time of the wedding, the Nanawares demanded a huge amount from us. Keeping in mind my daughter's future, I somehow managed to meet their demands. However, after just 20 days of the wedding, they started harassing my daughter for money as Narendra wanted to open a clinic. 

Dowry given at the time of wedding:
Gold ornaments worth Rs 4 lakh and household goods worth Rs 8 lakh.
