Description:
			Forty eight hours after the untimely demise of music director Chakri, his wife Sravani on Wednesday approached the State Human Rights Commission, alleging harassment by her in-laws, including both sisters-in-law, especially after he passed away.

However, it is said she was told that the Commission could not take her complaint as it was out of its jurisdiction and hence she left the place without lodging a complaint.

Later, she spoke to mediapersons at her residence and said that she sought the assistance of the Commission only out of the fear of what would happen to her in future.
