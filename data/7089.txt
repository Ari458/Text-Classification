Molestation
Description:
			Days after a teenaged girl was molested and thrown out of a speeding bus in Moga, a young woman was allegedly sexually harassment by a youth in a Punjab Roadways bus on Monday. Her angry family members stopped the bus at Nawanshahr and took it to police station. The youth, however, had already alighted at Balachaur.

According to reports, the woman had boarded the bus at Chandigarh, which left for Patti at 7.30pm. A youth boarded the bus at Ropar and sat next to her. After sometime, when she raised an alarm that the youth was harassing her, the conductor immediately made the youth shift to another seat.

When the bus reached Balachaur, the driver made the youth alight even though he had bought the ticket for Jadla village, which was another 15-20 kms away from Balachaur. Meanwhile, the woman informed her family at Paddo Matti village on Garhshankar-Nangal road about the incident on cellphone and they reached Nawanshahr around 9.30pm. When the bus reached the spot, they forced the driver and conductor to take it to police station even as the passengers pleaded that they were getting late.

The bus conductor informed the police that the accused youth had been boarding the bus daily for the last few weeks. He would board the bus at Ropar and alight at Jadla. They also explained his appearance and said that probably he worked in a bank but were not sure about it.

The woman's family allowed the bus to leave the police station after about an hour. The police officials were still recording the woman's statement at the time of filing this report.
