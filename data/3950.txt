Molestation
Description:
			Police on Tuesday arrested two auto-rickshaw drivers for allegedly trying to rape a 45-year-old woman at HUDA Colony, Attapur.

The woman was heading home when the accused duo -- Shaik Asif (30) and Syed Mustafa (31) -- tried to take advantage before she raised an alarm.

The police said the woman, after meeting her daughter, boarded the auto to reach her home at N.M. Guda.

After travelling some distance, another person boarded the auto. Instead of heading to N.M. Guda, the auto driver took a turn towards a narrow lane in HUDA Colony.

The person, who sat in the auto, started misbehaving with her.

When she tried resisting his attempts, he gagged her mouth and beat her up.

In the melee, she noticed one Raghavendra Reddy, known to her, and raised an alarm, requesting to rescue her following which Reddy followed the auto up to HUDA Colony.

He attacked both the auto drivers with the help of locals and rescued her.

Reddy later handed over the accused drivers to police. Asif was earlier involved in a rape case that took place in 2010.

The accused are residents of Rajendranagar.
