Rape
Description:
			Two men allegedly raped a medical student, filmed the assault and threatened to circulate its video.

The sexual assault came to light on Wednesday after the student's family lodged a complaint.
Police said the survivor belongs to Kanpur Dehat district and is pursuing her medical course from a private institute here.

"She lives in a rented accommodation in the city. One of the accused, Bhura Singh, who is studying at a local college, also stays in the same area. Often the girl's father used to send money and other things to his daughter through Bhura," said circle officer (CO) Rajesh Kumar.
"A couple of days ago, the girl's father approached Bhura and gave him some money, asking him to give it to his daughter. As usual, Bhura called up the girl on her mobile phone asking her to collect the money,'' said the complaint.

"But this time Bhura offered sedative-laced tea to the unsuspecting girl which made her unconscious. Bhura and one of his friends then raped her. The two also shot her MMS clip on their phones."

Police said the two threatened to post the MMS on social media if she reported the matter to police or her family. Initially, she kept quiet but later narrated her ordeal to her parents.
A police team has been rushed to possible hideouts of the accused in Kanpur Dehat and raids were underway to apprehend them.
