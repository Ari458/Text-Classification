Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			The Principal of a Meerut-based dental college Baljit Singh Hora has been booked by the police for alleged harassment of female students.

He has been charged under Section 354 of the IPC, relating to molestation. Following criticism, the police have also charged Mr Hora under the Goonda Act.

Female students have alleged that their principal had been sending them objectionable text messages and stalking them.

Mr. Hora rejected the allegations and said he was being framed by the students against whom he had initiated an enquiry for ragging.

There was a case of ragging against a student in which I initiated an enquiry. He in turn has made some female students complain against me. The enquiry against him for ragging is still pending. I am being framed for my stand against ragging, he said.

Several students The Hindu spoke to complained about Mr. Hora's roving eyes and harassment. A female student told The Hindu that the college principal not only sent vulgar and inappropriate messages to some of the students he also used CCTV cameras to stalk the girls on campus. The students also alleged that the college management committee had suppressed their complaints sent over last eight months. The college has no independent committee on gender sensitization to deal with gender related complaints.

The college management has constituted an internal enquiry to investigate the complaints. However the students are not satisfied with the move and have demanded Mr. Hora's immediate removal.

The Chairman of the college Anil Mehrotra reiterated that the committee would look into the complaints objectively. It is not true that we sat on the complaints of the students. Besides, we are also cooperating fully with the police investigation.
