Child Sexual Abuse, Molestation, Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			A principal of a private school was arrested by Ambala Cantonment police for allegedly sexually harassing a Class X girl. The girl had complained that the accused touched her inappropriately.

As the girl revealed the matter on Friday, her family members vented out their anger in front of the school. A group of women from the girl's family even slapped the principal repeatedly at Mahesh Nagar police station. The 45-year-old teacher is a resident of Ambala Cantonment.

In her complaint to the police, the girl said, "The principal would often pass lewd comments. This is the second time he called me in his office and touched me inappropriately. Previously, I ignored it as he had let me go after I resisted his attempt. On Thursday, he tried to repeat to all that and even forcibly attempted me to stop in his office. But I opened the door and rushed home immediately and narrated whole incident to my parents."

"We have arrested the principal after registering a case against him," Mahesh Nagar station house officer said.
