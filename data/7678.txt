Description:
			A youth was held by Anandnagar police on Thursday for harassing a girl late on Wednesday night. He was in one-sided love and was following the girl for some time, said investigators. 

According to police, parents of an 18-year-old girl approached police after a youth harassed the girl when she was standing outside her residence at a bungalow in Anandnagar. The youth reportedly rammed the bike he was driving into the girl's scooter and later threatened to throw acid on her if she dared to be with somebody else. 

"The youth studies in the same college and lives in Usmanpura. He had earlier tried to approach the girl but when he did not get any response, confronted her on Wednesday. Her parents got worried for the girl's safety and decided to approach police to stop the menace," said a police official.
