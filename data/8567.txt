Description:
			The Mahila Sessions Court here on Thursday sentenced Gogula Raju, 24, to 10-years imprisonment upholding charges of kidnapping and raping a minor girl in 2011. The court also ruled that Raju pay Rs 5 lakh as compensation to the victim.

A daily wage labourer, Raju befriended a minor girl in Krishnalanka and pretended to be in love with her. He forcefully took the girl away from her residence on August 22, 2011 and married her at Narasimha Swamy temple at Mattapalli village under Huzurnagar mandal in Nalgonda district of Telangana state. He sexually assaulted the girl for four days.

Based on a complaint lodged by the girl's father, the Krishnalanka police registered a missing case and started investigation. A few days later, the girl returned home and lodged a police complaint that Raju, who was already married, had cheated her by sexually abusing her after marrying her.

Following this, the police intensified their investigation under sections 363 and 376 of IPC and relevant sections of POCSO. Subsequently, Raju was arrested for kidnapping and was later released on bail.

The Mahila Court delivered the judgment after finding Raju guilty of criminal intimidation, cheating, causing hurt, wrongful confinement and sexual assault on a minor girl, under Section 4 of POCSO.

Fourteen persons deposed their witnesses in the case.
