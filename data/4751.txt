Murder
Description:
			A couple facing trial for the murder of a woman from Mokhada in the district has been acquitted by a local court for want of evidence.

The prosecution told the court that on March 14, 2010, the couple - Raghunath Budhar (45) and his wife Leela Budhar (40) - brutally murdered Kashibai Modak (40), who allegedly had an affair with Raghunath.

While the wife held the hands of the victim, her husband smashed the woman with a heavy stone after thrashing her. The duo then dumped the body in a thrashing yard of Chinchkar Pada village.

However, defence counsel P S Mahimkar challenged the prosecution story and said the couple had no connection whatsoever with the incident.

The defence challenged the deposition of the witnesses and said their statements were recorded after a delay of four days.

The defence also pointed out that the medical report failed to give the exact cause of the woman's death.

After hearing both the parties, Thane Additional Sessions Judge M C Khadke recently gave the couple benefit of doubt and absolved them of the charges under sections 302 rw 34 (murder) of the IPC.
