Murder
Description:
			A Class XII girl was murdered by her estranged boyfriend at her residence in Gummidipondy, 50 km from the city on Friday evening, allegedly after she started avoiding him and turned down his proposal for marriage.

The accused, S Vijay (19), an ITI graduate, was picked up from a neighbouring village on Saturday. The victim, R Rosammal (17) lived with her mother Ambika, a fruit vendor. On Friday evening, Ambika returned home from work to find her daughter lying dead, after which she alerted the police.

Arambakkam Police secured the body and moved it to a government hospital for autopsy. Since, it involved a minor girl, we requested for a team of three doctors to examine the body. It was confirmed that there was no sexual assault on her, at least on the day she was murdered, Arambakkam Inspector Sudalai Mani told Express.

According to the Inspector, there were no other external injuries on the girl's body. He had not used any weapons. He strangulated her to death with bare hands, the inspector added.

Police investigations revealed that the duo were in a relationship earlier. However, their relationship became strained as Vijay allegedly took to drinking and tried to force her into marrying him. It was during one such argument on Friday that the teenager was killed, police said. The accused was produced before a magistrate and remanded to borstal school in Puzhal prison.
