Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A 29-year-old man was arrested on Saturday for allegedly raping a 10-year-old girl in Kapurbawdi repeatedly. The girl's parents said they came to know of the alleged assault after she complained of pain in her private parts and told her parents about being abused by the neighbourhood "uncle" for the last three months. 

Shivmani Ramdular Jaiswar, a painter, allegedly took advantage of the fact that the girl was alone at home with her siblings as her mother worked as a help and her father was in Delhi for some time. Jaiswar lured the girl with money and chocolates and also asked the other children to leave the girl's home after giving them goodies, the police said. 

He threatened the girl, saying her parents would be angry if she complained to them. 

Jaiswar was produced before the Thane magistrate court and remanded to police custody as the cops said they wanted to find out if he was involved in other cases of abuse.
