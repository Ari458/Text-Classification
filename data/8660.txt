Description:
			A 19-year-old student died of excessive bleeding at Veeragollahalli village in Chikkaballapura taluk after her boyfriend administered her folk medicine that was mixed in a soft drink so that she could have an abortion.

Geetha was found unconscious by the side of a road. She was shifted to a private hospital and later to M.S. Ramaiah Hospital in Bengaluru, where she passed away.

Geetha's parents and family staged a protest in front of the house of the accused, Naresh, demanding his arrest. However, Naresh reportedly managed to escape.

Geetha's parents have alleged that their daughter was in a relationship with Naresh and was three months pregnant. They also claimed that Naresh, who was married, forced her to drink the soft drink laced with folk medicine for an abortion on Monday. Geetha, who was on her way to college, started bleeding and collapsed.

The Chikkaballapura police are on the lookout for Naresh.
