Description:
			Small-time TV actor Sarvjeet Singh who got short roles in Ajay Devgn-starrer Phool Aur Kaante (1991) and Chand Ke Paar Chalo (2006) has been on the run ever since he was accused of raping a 17-year-old in Pilibhit. 

With medical reports confirming rape of the girl, the 45-year-old actor, who also runs a dance academy in the city, has fled to Mumbai ever since an FIR was filed against him, said police. Cops have put his mobile phone on surveillance to trace his location. 

On Monday, police had lodged an FIR against the actor on the basis of a complaint by the survivor who is a student at Singh's dance academy. The girl alleged that Singh got into a physical relationship with her last year after he promised to marry her once she turns 18. 

When the girl discovered that Singh was already married, she confronted him. Following this, Singh threatened her with a video clip that he had made of the girl. The girl alleged that Singh blackmailed her and raped her several times. 

On Monday, she finally decided to take action against him and informed her parents, who filed an FIR against the accused. Brijesh Singh, station officer, Sunghadi police station, told TOI, "Medical reports have confirmed that the girl was raped. We are trying our best to arrest the accused. A team will soon be sent to Mumbai to find him. We are sure that he is in Mumbai as he has many contacts there."
