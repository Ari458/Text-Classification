Description:
			Narendra Rana, 40, was arrested from his residence at Murar in Gwalior, six months after he killed his two-day-old daughter by feeding her nicotine, an official said.

Rana's wife Anita had delivered a girl child on October 17 2011 at a private hospital. The infant was found dead two days later.

The post-mortem report was handed to police only last month. "It revealed that the baby had died due to consumption of nicotine," a police official said.

According to Suryakant Awasthi, in-charge of Murar police station, Mrs Anita had said that Mr Rana was depressed with the birth of a baby girl. He had entered the ward the day their daughter was found dead. 

Mrs Anita has also alleged that while she was pregnant, both her husband and mother-in-law had threatened to kill her baby. "They started torturing me for dowry immediately after my marriage. Both said they would kill my baby," she added.
