Domestic Violence, Dowry Harassment, Other
Description:
			The Kozhikode Marad Special Additional Sessions Court on Tuesday sentenced a woman to seven year rigorous imprisonment in connection with the suicide of her daughter-in-law following dowry harassment at Kudaranji six years ago.

The judge awarded the punishment to Valli (47) of Kudaranji after finding her guilty under Section 304 B (dowry death) of the Indian Penal Code. Chellottil Soumya, wife of Valli's son Gireesh, had tried to commit suicide after pouring kerosene over her body on March 2, 2008. She succumbed to her injuries on March 30.

According to prosecution, Valli had been harassing Soumya demanding the remaining dowry of around 1.75 sovereigns of gold. The judge said though the accused is liable for life imprisonment, the term has been reduced to seven years considering that she was a woman.

Soumya's husband Gireesh (30), his aunt Ganga (42), who were accused in the case, were acquitted. The case against the minor sister of Gireesh is proceeding at the juvenile court.
