Foeticide/Infanticide
Description:
			The bodies of two newborn girls, with stray dogs huddling around, were today found in a drain in Batala area of the district.

According to the police, a farmer in Ranger Nangal village noticed that some dogs had assembled near the drain and on a closer look he found the bodies. He later informed the police.
