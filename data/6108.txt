			A railway police constable has been arrested by the police for allegedly molesting a 28-year- old married woman in north Delhi's Chandni Chowk area.

45-year-old Kuldeep, who was in an inebriated state at the time of the alleged offence, later roughed up the woman's husband as well, police said.

"The woman was headed towards the market after coming out of the Gurdwara in Chandni Chowk when the accused started misbehaving with her and even touched her inappropriately," police said.

He was arrested on Tuesday after the woman approached the local police patrolling in the area and complained about him, they said.

"When the woman's husband tried to intervene and stop him, he allegedly threatened that he belonged to the Railway Police Force and he would go untouched," police added.

Police said that the accused was booked and sent behind bars after the woman's statement was recorded.

Kuldeep, who hails from Rohtak in Haryana, is a constable with the Railway Police Force at the Old Delhi Railway Station, police said.
