Murder, Foeticide/Infanticide
Description:
			Upset over not having a son, an unemployed man strangled his four-month-old daughter at Chandni Mahal in central Delhi on Thursday. The accused, Khaleel (30) has been arrested. The child was his fifth daughter.

Police said, Khaleel frequently fought with his wife over a son and he was depressed after their fifth daughter was born.

On Thursday evening, Khaleel took his four-month-old daughter with him telling his wife that he is going for a walk with the daughter. His wife, who is a housewife, got worried when he didn't return till midnight. She said she started looking in the nearby area and also asked the relatives and friends if he had come to their place. She then decided to get a missing case registered in the morning.

She told police that the baby was lying in the room in the morning but was unconscious. She sensed something wrong and made a PCR call at the same time.

A senior police officer said that at initial investigation it seemed as if the child had died due to starvation. But the case became clear after the postmortem report showed that the child died of 'manual strangulation'

Two teams were formed to nab the culprit father, who had been absconding. Khaleel was arrested from Paharganj.

During investigation, the wife told police that her husband is an alcoholic and can not remain without alcohol. So, the team started raiding all the liquor shops in the area.

On the basis of the local intelligence, the team got a tip-off that the man was lying at a liquor shop in Paharganj. He was traced and arrested from there.

The man, during interrogation, confessed of having committed the crime. He has been booked under IPC 302 (murder) and has been sent to judicial custody.
