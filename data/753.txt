Description:
			Unable to stand rejection from the girl he loved, a teen took the help of his friend to make a fake Facebook profile of the girl to 'teach her a lesson'.

Accused used his home computer and internet connection to create a fake profile of the 16-year-old. He then uploaded morphed pictures of the girl and gave out her name, address, phone number, and even posted details about her family members. He had even written some lewd comments on the profile.

Soon the girl started getting calls from people who wanted to 'talk dirty' to her. Frustrated by the constant lewd calls, the girl informed her father, who in turn informed the cops.
