Description:
			An 18-year-old married woman committed suicide in her Nathupur home on Friday night. The teenager's family has alleged she was driven to commit suicide due to harassment by her husband and his family. Sunil, the woman's husband, has been arrested and sent to judicial custody.

Surbhi and Sunil got married in July. However soon after the marriage Sunil and his family started to verbally and physically abuse her. This caused her to hang herself from a hook in the ceiling with a dupatta. According to the police, she was still alive when her husband found her.
