Child Sexual Abuse, Molestation, Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			A school student committed suicide by hanging herself at her residence in Kancheepuram after allegedly being sexually assaulted by her teacher.

The 17-year-old Plus Two student from Cheyyur near Maduranthagam in Kancheepuram district left behind a suicide note blaming her chemistry teacher for the extreme step.

Angry relatives resorted to a road blockade demanding immediate action against the teacher Ramesh (38).

Following this, police arrested him on charges of sexual harassment. He is likely to be booked for abetting the suicide once the post-mortem results are made available.

In her suicide note addressed to the school headmaster, the girl briefly explained about the behaviour of the teacher and that she would not be able to face anyone once this incident came to light.

She stated that she was targeted in the past week, but was scared to expose him fearing that it would shame her as well. The girl said in the note that she was not the only person targeted by the teacher and alleged that he had abused other children in the class as well.

“Nobody complained so far, but I want to ensure that none suffers because of him henceforth. I don’t know whether you would believe me if I told about him. I want to bring him to book at least through my death. Please punish him for all that he did,” the two-page note read.

Police said preliminary investigations had revealed that Ramesh would burden the girl with more class work during the evening special class.

“He would ensure that she doesn’t get to go home early. He would then isolate her on the pretext of assigning more work,” said a senior police official privy to the investigation.

The deceased girl, who is a native of Tindivanam had moved in with her grandmother to Cheyyur in order to get better education.
