Murder
Description:
			A woman was set afire and later beaten to death by her 16-year-old son, who suspected her to be in an illicit relationship.

According to Punjab Police Inspector Harish Behal, the youth was very upset with his 50-year-old widowed mother, whom he suspected to be in an illicit affair with another man after his father passed away.

Angry over this, the boy poured petrol over his mother and set her on fire, but when this did not kill her, he hit his mother using a sharp-edged weapon causing her death on the spot at their home in Majetha locality here today, Behal said.
