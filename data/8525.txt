Child Sexual Abuse, Molestation
Description:
			First Additional Sessions Judge K.P. Indira on Thursday sentenced Reji, 29, of Mudavoorkonam, near Kallambalam, to two years of rigorous imprisonment on charges of sexually harassing two minor girls by resorting to exhibitionism. Reji was also asked to pay a penalty to Rs.10,000 to his victims, the failure of which would result in an extension of his sentence by three months.

The case that led to the conviction took place in 2014, when the accused allegedly lifted his dhoti and showed obscene gestures to two girls, aged seven and five, who were his neighbours. The children had complained to their parents, following which a complaint was lodged with the Kallambalam police.
