Murder, Rape
Description:
			The bosy of an 18-year old girl was found near Barewal Bridge Thursday. The body had deep head injuries and the legs were tied with a piece of cloth. The police and doctors suspect the victim was raped and swab samples were sent for testing after the post-mortem examination. 

The victim's mother said, On Wednesday morning, her father had dropped her to school. When she did not return even after 2.30 pm, I checked with neighbours and her friend's residences but she was not there. A nearby store owner told me that she had visited. I went to her school again and requested that the premises be checked. We then lodged a missing complaint, she said. 

Around 3.30 am Thursday, the school bag and ID card of the victim were recovered near Jawaddi and the family were informed that the body of a girl had been found. The post-mortem report says she was strangled to death. She was assaulted on the head, it says. 

She was probably raped before being killed. Her legs were tied and there are signs that she struggled a lot, said Ramandeep Singh, assistant commissioner of police, Atam Nagar.
