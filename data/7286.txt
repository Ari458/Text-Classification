Description:
			A 27-year-old woman from Mumbai, who has allegedly been subject to sexual harassment online by an unidentified man from Bengaluru for the past six months, has now approached the city police for help. She emailed her complaint to the IT wing (which deals with cyber crimes) on Monday after she was turned away by the Mumbai police citing jurisdictional issues.

It all started in January. The victim, an entrepreneur settled in Mumbai, said: "My husband received a crank call from Bengaluru, and I have been harassed on a social networking site ever since". In an email to The Hindu , she said she knew it was the same person when the messages and letters she received on the site matched the caller's words. The man even hacked into her personal accounts, and posted obscene and morphed images to defame her, she alleged.

Screenshots of some of the messages showed her being threatened; in one, the accused claimed to have henchmen.

"He would stalk me on a social networking site and send me letters with morphed images of me and my friends with concocted stories", she said.

Unable to bear the harassment, the victim has logged off from social media. "I am just a middle-class woman and my mother has fallen sick due to the stress he is causing me and my family. It is like virtual rape," the victim said.

She approached Mumbai police in March. But they did not file an FIR since the accused is in Bengaluru. "They asked me to approach the Bengaluru police," she said.

Abishek Goyal, Deputy Commissioner of Police (in-charge of IT wing), said the police is trying to ascertain whether the perpetrator is from Bengaluru.
