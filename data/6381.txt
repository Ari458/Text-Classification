Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A class VIII girl was gang-raped twice within three days by a group of four neighbours, including a minor, in Sonarpur area of South 24 Parganas district, the police said today.

Though the incident occurred late last month, it came to light yesterday when the teenaged girl revealed the matter to her mother.

The victim, a resident of Garia locality, was going for tuition on January 27 when two boys who were known to her took her to some place on a motorcycle.

Later, two others, of whom one is a minor, reached there and she was gangraped by the four, the police said.

The accused took photos of the act with their mobile phones and threatened the girl that they would circulate the pictures if she told anyone about the incident.

The scared girl, daughter of a mason, returned home and kept mum.

The gang-rape was repeated on January 29 when she was going for tuition again, police said.

Following the second rape the victim quit going to school or tuition.

Yesterday, when her mother, a homemaker, enquired why she was not attending to school or tuition, she disclosed the ordeal to her.

Her family members lodged a police complaint and two accused were arrested last night. They were remanded to seven days police custody by a Baruipur court.

The other two accused, including the minor boy, are absconding, the police said.

The incident is grim reminder of the Barasat gang-rape incident wherein a 16-year-old girl from North 24 Parganas district was gangraped twice, the second one for daring to lodge a police complaint in October 2013. She later committed suicide.
