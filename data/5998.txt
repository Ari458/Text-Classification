Description:
			The daughter-in-law of a senior judge of the Madras high court has moved the court to register a criminal case against the judge's son and wife for attempt to murder, abetment to suicide and dowry harassment.

Anootha Chandran, 30, of Kerala, said she married D Bala Rajendra Prabhu on February 22, 2013 and trouble erupted soon after. Anootha said she was harassed for dowry, beaten up and scolded when she questioned her husband's manners. She said her eight-month-old daughter too suffered injury.

Though she lodged a complaint with the All Women Police Station in Mylapore, no FIR was registered, she said. She said her husband's side insisted that her family claim the expenses of the marriage held at a star hotel in Chennai and purchase an Audi car. Her father declined both the suggestions saying he had no sources to account for the expenditure.

On Wednesday, prosecution informed Justice S Nagamuthu that the complaint had been closed as allegations were found to be false. The woman's counsel, however, told the judge that she had certain evidence to prove the harassment. The court then adjourned the case to December 22 and asked counsel to furnish evidence of harassment.
