With Monday's arrests, the total number of those held so far has reached eight, including two teachers.

"Block Education Officer (BEO) SS Navarji and Additional Block Education Officer (ABEO) Jitendra Kumar Nayak were booked for inaction against the rape accused when the incident came to light in November last year," Superintendent of Police Rahul Bhagat said.
