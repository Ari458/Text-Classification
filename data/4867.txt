			Adding to the cases of crime against women being reported from Uttar Pradesh, two women were allegedly raped by their neighbours in the Jewar area.

FIRs in both the cases were lodged today, they said, adding that the accused were absconding.

In the first incident reported last night, a woman was allegedly kidnapped by her two bike-borne neighbours, who took her to a lonely stretch and raped her turn by turn.

The Jewar police has lodged a case and sent the victim for medical examination.

The accused-- Kalua and Raza-- were absconding.

They also threatened to kill her if she reported the matter to the police.
