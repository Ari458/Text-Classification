Abuse
Description:
			The accused arrived at (friend) Kamlesh's home and Victim (Neighbour) informed him that as no one was at home he may leave. However, Waseem grabbed the chance as no one was at the house and caught Sangeeta and tried molest her however he failed due to stiff opposition from the girl.

Victim felt humilated and she locked herself in the house. Soon unable to bear the guilt, she immolated herself by pouring kerosene.
