Murder, Dowry Harassment
Description:
			The court of additional district and sessions judge Amit Kumar on Friday sentenced a person to life imprisonment for dowry death. The court also slapped a fine of Rs 10,000 on the convict.

According to the prosecution, the victim, Ritu (30), was found dead at her in-laws' house at Tibbi Mohalla Kheda Sitaram, Kalka, on December 13, 2014. The post-mortem revealed that she died of strangulation.

Ritu, a Dalit and a native of Sirmaur in Himachal Pradesh, was in a relationship with Vijay Sharma and had married him about five years ago.

She was a tenant at Sharma's house following which the duo fell in love and got married. After the post-mortem report, Ritu's father Sundar Singh complained to the police that her daughter was harassed by her in-laws for dowry.

On his complaint, the police registered a case under Sections 304B (dowry death) and 120A (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and under relevant sections of the Scheduled Castes and Tribes (prevention of atrocities) Act.

The couple has a boy Divansh (5). Ritu's parents said her in-laws had harassed her on several occasions in the past, but the two parties would settle on a compromise whenever Ritu's parents decided to file a police complaint.

After having faced constant harassment, Ritu had gone to her parents' residence during Diwali last year. However, Sharma had brought her back on December 9, after which the duo continued to fight.

The court concluded that Sharma had a strong motive to kill Ritu.
