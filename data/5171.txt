Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			Brajrajnagar police on Friday arrested a man for allegedly raping a four-year-old girl of Sarasmal village in Jharsuguda district the previous day. The incident came close on the heels of the rape of a six-year-old Odia schoolgirl in Bangalore.

Police identified him as Rabi Chandra Kharsel, 34, of Bagiamal village under Badmal police limits. The accused allegedly lured the girl with a promise of providing her some snacks on Thursday afternoon. He then took her to a forest near Junanimunda village on a motorcycle and raped her.

Some women, who had gone to the forest to pluck mushrooms, raised an alarm after spotting them. They along with the forest watchman nabbed Kharsel after chasing him for nearly half-a-km. He was hiding under a drain. Kharsel was then handed over to Orient police at Brajrajnagar, said SP (Jharsuguda) S Shyni.

The accused and the girl were sent for medical examination. "We have registered a case under Sections 363 (kidnapping of minor girl), 366 (kidnapping of a girl for illegal relation and marriage), 367 (kidnapping in order to subject a person to grievous hurt) and 376 (rape) of the IPC and Section (6) 5(m) (sexual assault to a minor below 12 year of age) of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012," she said.

Campaigner Anandani Padhi said. "After the Nirvaya case in 2013, reports of minor girls being raped are pouring in. The accused in such cases should be awarded harshest punishment," she said.
