Description:
			A 27-year-old man and six of his family members were booked on Tuesday for allegedly killing his wife for dowry.

Family members of the deceased, Komal (22), alleged her body was disposed of without conducting a post-mortem as police were not informed about the death.

Komal's family members told TOI that her parents-in-law informed them about her death around 12.30 pm on Monday.

"We were told that Komal had committed suicide by hanging herself from a ceiling fan. But instead of asking us to go to their Loni residence, her parents-in-law asked us to reach their ancestral village, Gothra, in Baghpat, directly to attend the funeral. The pyre was already lit by the time we had reached there," said Komal's 25-year-old brother Sachin.

He added, "Other relatives who had seen the body said Komal's toenails had been pulled off and her wrists had been slashed."

Komal was married to Kuldeep, who works at a shop in Chandni Chowk in Delhi, in July 2010. They have a four-year-old son.

"Komal visited us on January 31. She had complained that her parents-in-law were pressurising her to marry of my younger sister, Rachna, to a cousin of Kuldeep who is disabled," said Sachin, adding, "She also said her parents-in-law were forcing her to ask us for money to purchase a car. We agreed on giving her the money but we rejected the marriage proposal."

A complaint in this regard was lodged by Komal's father, Srichand, at Loni Border police station on Tuesday.

"Seven people including Kuldeep, his parents and other relatives have been named as accused in the case," said a police officer.

However, no arrests have been made so far.
"Investigations are under way," the officer added.
