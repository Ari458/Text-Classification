Rape
Description:
			Reena (name changed) was heading to her residence in Gharad village in Kalmeshwar after work when she was intercepted by Chambare near the banks of Kharak river on February 23 in 2009. He forced Reena to sit on his cycle. Gotmare joined Chambare a little later and the duo dragged Reena to a desolate place. 

While Gotmare pinned her down, Chambare raped her. Later, Gotmare forced himself on her. They later took Reena to another place near a well before taking turns to rape her again, after consuming liquor.

Though Chambare and Gotmare could have been sentenced to up to minimum 10 years, the sessions court considered their "socioeconomic" situation and passed an order accordingly.

Having read what happened to the victim, do you really think that the guilty have been punished according to the gravity of the crime that they have committed?
