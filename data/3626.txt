Description:
			A man has been sentenced to 10 years in jail by a Delhi court for sexually assaulting his 11-year-old daughter in an inebriated condition.

Additional Sessions Judge Illa Rawat held the 40-year-old Delhi resident guilty of penetrative sexual assault under the provisions of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.

The incident took place on the night of March 15 when the child's mother had gone to a relative's residence and the victim and her siblings were left in the house with their father.

When the minor's siblings were sleeping, the man sexually assaulted her in an inebriated state, she informed her mother about the incident after two days.

The matter was reported to the police and the man was arrested on March 17.

During the trial, the man claimed that the evidence against him was incorrect and he had been falsely implicated in the case by his daughter, wife and the NGO officials.

However the medical report of the child corroborated her statement that she was sexually assaulted by her father.

It also said the testimony of the victim in the case clearly brought out the traumatic experience she suffered at the hands of the accused.

The court directed that a copy of its order be sent to Delhi Government's Principal Secretary (Home), Chief Secretary, Principal Secretary (Social Welfare) and Director of Department of Social Welfare (Women and Child Development) for information and necessary action under its intimation.
