Abuse
Description:
			An indebted 45-year-old woman attempted suicide after a man raped her and insulted her when she failed to repay him 7000 loan on time. Fortunately, the woman was rushed to the hospital by her children where she is undergoing treatment.

The accused Bharat Dhargave (45) has been arrested by MIDC police and booked on rape charges. Dhargave works with a private firm. He was produced in the court on Saturday.

As per the woman's complaint, she was facing some financial problems and had thus taken 7000 from Dhargave a few months ago. When she failed to arrange the money, she asked Dhargave to give her some more time to repay.

On October 21, Dhargave visited the woman's home and demanded his money. The woman was alone. She told the police that she again pleaded Dhargave to give some time, but he abused her and raped her.

The woman claimed she did not tell anybody about the incident for the sake of her family's reputation in society.

On October 27, Dhargave called the woman at his home and again insulted her in front of his wife. Depressed over the humiliation, the woman chose to end her life and consumed insecticide.

The victim's daughter and son rushed her to hospital where she is undergoing treatment. The woman then decided to file a complaint and reported the matter to MIDC police.
