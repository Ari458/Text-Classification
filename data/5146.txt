Rape
Description:
			In an incident which has yet again shaken the trust traditionally put in family ties, a 22-year-old girl was raped by her cousin, a minor, in her house coming under Kalamna police station jurisdiction on Friday. It seems that women are not safe in their own homes from their own families.

The victim Sunita (name changed) was alone in her house when the incident happened. As usual she remained at home when her mother and younger brother went out for work. Her father is no more.

Around 1pm, the accused, Ratan (name changed) a 16-year-old first cousin of Sunita, entered her house. "He was her paternal first cousin and thus would visit the family sometimes," said API P B Burade of Kalamna police station who registered the case. Ratan then pushed Sunita forcibly on the bed, covered her mouth to ensure that she made no noise and then raped her.

The girl later narrated the incident to her mother. "They registered a case the next evening. They were probably hesitant due to the shame factor associated with rape cases and the fact that it was a near relative who had done it," said Burade. The police said that there was no mention of the accused troubling the girl on any earlier occasion.

Following this, a case of rape under the section 376 (2) (F) has been registered. The accused, since a minor, has been detained by the police. "We will be sending both, the victim and the accused, for medical test," said Burade.
