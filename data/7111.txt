Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			The Borivali police has arrested a 44-year-old man, who has three wives, for allegedly raping a four-year-old girl known to him in Borivali (west) on Tuesday. According to the Borivali police, the accused is identified as Suresh Asthake and works as a daily wage labourer. He is a resident of a slum area in Borivali (west) and the victim lives in his neighbourhood.
The rape occurred somewhere between 5 pm to 6 pm on Tuesday. Asthake lured the victim into his house when his wives were away. The victim knew him and so did not raise an alarm. Fortunately, while he was taking the victim into his room, her eight-year-old sister saw them. After she came crying around 6 pm, the elder sister raised an alarm. The mother of the victim then approached the Borivali police with a complaint. The victim's father is a labourer.
Looking at the seriousness of the issue, we promptly registered an FIR and arrested him on Tuesday night soon after receiving her mother’s complaint. Both the accused and victim have been subjected to a medical test, said senior police inspector Narayan Khaire of Borivali police station.
The police said that two of Asthake's wives live with him in the chawl, while the third one lives in Dahisar. He also has children. Asthake has been booked under section 376 (rape) of the Indian Penal Code and under section 4 (penetrative sexual assault), 7 (sexual assault) and 12 (sexual harassment) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (Pocso). He was produced before a magistrate’s court and has been remanded to police custody till June 8 for further probe.
