Abuse
Description:
			An alleged Trinamul youth activist has been accused of abusing a nurse at a primary health centre in Malda and threatening to assault and kidnap her.

Sources said a woman had come to the health centre in Harishchandrapur last night on Trinamul leader Ziaur Rehman's advice after being beaten by her husband.

When the nurse and some of her colleagues told her she would have to wait as they were attending to other patients, she called up Rehman, former block president of the now-defunct Trinamul Yuva.
 
The nurse said Rehman arrived at the facility with his associates at 8.30pm. "He abused me in filthy language and threatened to slap me. He also threatened to abduct me," she said.

A police complaint has been lodged against Rehman. Amlan Bhaduri, the Trinamul Youth Congress chief in Malda, said Rehman was no longer associated with the party.

Rehman, however, said he was a part of Trinamul and denied threatening the nurse. "The allegations against me are concocted," he said.
