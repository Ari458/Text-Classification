Description:
			The marriage ceremony at Konhara Ghat area under the Nagar police station of Hajipur   turned into a horror tale for the 22-year-old Sanjana (name changed) the next morning when Manish Kumar, 30, the paramilitary personnel posted in Bokaro, found a glitch in a vidaii ritual and started creating a ruckus. Not only did he beat up Sanjana mercilessly, Manish allegedly assaulted his mother-in-law, brother-in-law and sister-in-law as well. 

Sanjana's mother tried to pacify Manish. But he dragged her quite a distance and beat her up. The paramilitary personnel then got hold of a rod and started being up Sanjana's brother and sister violently,the inspector added. 

He added that Manish was also accused of allegedly tearing Sanjana's mangal sutra (a necklace worn by married Hindu women) during the assault.
