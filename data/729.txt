Abuse
Description:
			Zarin (name changed) from Lashkaribagh was allegedly violated for the second time by the same suspended constable within six months'. This led her to file another rape complaint against the person at the Pachpaoli police station. 

in June, Zarin had registered a rape complaint against the constable at the Pachpaoli police station. 

The constable walked out of jail after securing a bail and had been harassing her since the release and finally once again assaulted and shut her up at his Kamal Chowk residence. Zarin shudders with fear at the very mention of constable's name who was a friend till 2009. "The culprit's family is very dangerous. I feel helpless before their threats"
