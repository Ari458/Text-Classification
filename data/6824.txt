Dowry Harassment, Rape
Description:
			A 32-year-old man and his parents have been booked for torturing his wife for dowry. The husband has also been charged for allegedly raping her before getting married to her, in January 2013, police said. 

The 23-year-old woman stated in her complaint, lodged earlier this week, that she had met Vivek Kumar Bajad in January 2013 through Facebook. He had called her home and offered her a drug laced drink before allegedly raping her. He married her when she threatened to call the police and they started living together for nine months in Bangalore. However, he soon started seeing other girls for marriage and when she confronted him, he sent her to her parents' house. She followed him when he got transferred to Gurgaon last year, and they re-married in July 2014. 

She added that her in-laws started harassing her for dowry thereafter. It was in January this year, when Bajad left her at her parents' home and broke all communication. He and his parents have been missing ever since, the woman alleged.
