Dowry Harassment
Description:
			The deceased Sindhurani, 30, had married Prakash of Kumbalgod three years ago. The couple were living at a rented house near Vidyapeetha Road in Kengeri. 

In a statement to the tahsildar, Ramakrishne Gowda, the father of Sindhurani, alleged that Prakash was harassing his daughter over dowry.

In his complaint, however, Prakash has said that he had gone to a temple on Sunday morning and when he returned his wife did not answer his knocks on the door.

He claimed that he scaled the wall and peeped in through a ventilator to see her hanging in the hall. He broke open the door and retrieved the body.
