Child Sexual Abuse, Molestation
Description:
			A 21-year-old youth has been arrested for allegedly molesting his own minor sister inside their home in west Delhi's Mianwali.

The incident happened last night after which the victim and her mother caught him, thrashed him and handed him over to the police.

"The accused had returned home drunk last night. As there was a power cut in the area, his mother went to sleep on the terrace. Finding his 16-year-old sister alone in the house, the youth allegedly tried to misbehave with her and even tried to disrobe her in an attempt to rape her," said a police official.

As the girl tried to raise an alarm, he tried to gag her in order to prevent her from shouting. She somehow managed to flee from his clutches and called her mother.

The mother then caught hold of him, took him out on the street and thrashed him. She also asked her daughter to make a PCR call.

"We received a PCR call about the incident at 1.30 AM following which a team was sent to the spot and the accused was arrested," the official said.

The girl is a Class 11 student at a government school in the area while the accused is currently unemployed.

"He had been jailed in 2012 for a robbery in Mangolpuri area. He was released only a few months ago," said the officer.

The family lived in a rented one room accommodation.

The mother-daughter duo told police that the accused had allegedly tried to molest her even a fortnight ago in an inebriated state. The victim had complained to her mother who had scolded him. The matter was, however, not reported to police then.
