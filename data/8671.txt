Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			The court of additional district and sessions judge (ADJ) Daya Lal Prasad on Monday awarded life imprisonment to one Kamlesh Sahani of Jhakiya village in connection with gang-rape of an 11-year-old girl. The speedy trial in the case had started in the court on July 4. The court also slapped a fine of Rs 1 lakh on Sahani, which will be paid to the rape survivor. The case against second accused was transferred to juvenile court after medical report established that he was a minor at the time of committing the crime.

The girl, a resident of Bediban-Madhuban village under Pipra police station in East Champaran district, was gang-raped on June 15 this year. Her father had lodged an FIR with Pipra police station on June 16. The police arrested the two accused on June 16 and submitted charge sheet against them on June 25, requesting the court for speedy trial.

The girl was brutalised and gangraped in a mango orchard at Bediban-Madhuban village where she had gone to collect mangoes. She was admitted in Motihari sadar hospital before being shifted to Patna Medical College and Hospital in a critical condition.

The incident had triggered widespread protests in the district with members of different organisations holding rallies to vent their ire on the administration. The victim's father said his daughter was initially treated with contributions from locals. "The district administration later provided only Rs 25,000 as medical relief," he added. The Bihar State Human Rights Commission had directed the government to provide Rs 1.25 lakh as compensation to the girl.
