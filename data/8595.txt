Murder
Description:
			A 54-year-old woman teacher Rayaprolu Padmavathi was murdered while her adopted daughter Madhavi and another person were injured in an attack by a gang of three persons at Childrens Park locality, on the outskirts of Nellore city, on Saturday.

The miscreants gained entry forcefully and inflicted stab wounds with knives on the three residents.

After hearing the loud shrieks from the house, neighbours came into the house and caught one K. Venkateswarlu while the two others escaped from the scene. They handed over the accused to the police.

SP Vishal Gunni visited the scene of offence and said that it would take a day or two to find out the exact motive behind the murder as the injured persons were unable to speak with clarity as they were still in shock. Meanwhile, the arrested person Venkateswarlu was being questioned by the police. It was found out that he belongs to Yerragatlapalli village in Vinjamur mandal. The details about the two other accused are yet to be known. Padmavathi had been working as a school teacher at a village near Sangham area. Her husband R. Nageswara Rao is an auditor and has been practising in Nellore city for the past several years. Preliminary investigations revealed that Padmavathi had a heated exchange of words with some other family sometime ago. It was being probed whether there was a property dispute or professional rivalry.

Nellore Rural MLA Kotamreddy Sridhar Reddy consoled the family members of the victim.
