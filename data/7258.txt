Abuse
Description:
			A 25-year-old woman who was walking home along with a male friend was eve-teased, sexually abused and assaulted by two men in a car at Nalasopara on Friday night. Her friend was also roughed up by the men. 

The woman was returning from work. As she was walking on Achole Road in Nalasopara (east) along with her friend at around 11 pm, a Maruti Swift car stopped in front of them. The driver of the car called out to her while the person seated on the rear seat asked her "What are your charges?". The woman and her male friend were upset and argued with the accused. 

The two men got out of the car and blew punches at the woman's friend. When she intervened one of the accused slapped her and touched her inappropriately. They accused her of roaming with a guy. They then fled from the spot. The woman noted down the car registration number of the accused and filed a complaint with the Tulinj police station. 

A case under sections 354 (A) (sexual harassment), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) 427 (mischief) and 34 (common intention) of the IPC has been registered. No arrest has been made.
