Molestation, Murder
Description:
			Udham Singh Nagar police nabbed the mother and brothers of the 18-year-old woman who was suspected to have been killed for honour by them. 

The accused  Bhhori (58) and her two sons Arif (21) and Nazim (24)  were caught at their relatives' place on Sunday, police said. They had allegedly strangulated the girl to death after hitting her with an iron rod in Kahipur in the early hours of May 10 and buried her body inside the house. 

Police said the accused were against the victim's open-minded behaviour like interacting with others and talking on mobile phone. "As she used to talk a lot with her friends and relatives, especially her elder sister Rukhsar (29) who lives in Haldwani, the accused assumed that she was having an 'inter-religion affair," they said. 

Cops added that one of the brothers had tried to sexually assault her on several occasions in the past and on May 9, the girl had run away from home, threatening to expose all of them. The girl's sister, Shabana, said their mother convinced her to return from Kashipur railway station and the very next day she was killed. 

"The accused have been arrested and jailed," said Kamlesh Upadhyay, additional superintendent of police, Kashipur. 

Police said that the girl's father, Nazir Hussain (61) left the house about three years ago after being assaulted by his wife and two sons. Among her eight siblings, three brothers and five sisters the victim was seventh child of Bhoori. 

The murder was revealed when the victim's elder sister Shabana (20) returned from their elder sister Rukhsar's home on Thursday. 

When Rukhsar inquired about the girl, her mother told her that she went to their relative's place. "How can a mother do such a thing? She never helped her against Arif when he tried to rape her," a visibly upset Rukhsar told cops.
