Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A 17-year-old boy was arrested here on Friday for raping a minor girl three years ago. 

The girl, now 12 and reading in Class 6 at a government school, mustered the courage to report the incident after she attended an awareness camp on sexual abuse. The girl narrated her ordeal to her friends. One of them then alerted the child welfare committee. 

The committee members enquired and recorded the statement of the victim. The panel also lodged a complaint with Villianur police who then registered a case against the minor boy under Sections 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) and 376 (punishment for rape) and detained him. 

Police produced him before a juvenile court that sent him to an observation home. A policeman said frequent awareness campaigns organised by the department of women and child development and child welfare committee at schools have emboldened victims to come out and report incidents of sexual abuse. 

In another incident, C Murugan, 31, a daily wager, sexually abused a nine-year-old girl. Murugan, who was under the influence of alcohol, spotted the minor playing in front of her house while he was returning home at Thirukkanur on the outskirts of the town. With the girl's parents away at work, Murugan took her inside the house and raped her. When the girl's aunt dropped by, she was shocked to find a stranger abusing her niece. The woman raised an alarm and alert neighbours managed to overpower Murugan. 

Thirukkanur police registered a case against Murugan, reportedly separated from his wife following issues of alcohol abuse, under Section 8 (punishment for sexual assault) of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act. They arrested him and produced him before a local court that remanded him in judicial custody.
