Street Harassment
Description:
			A gang of five waylaid a woman in a residential locality in Barrackpore on Friday night and molested her in front of her family members when she tried to fight back. 

The woman and some of her relatives - all of them elderly women - had boarded an autorickshaw at Manikdanga on their way to attend a wedding. It was around 10pm and there were few people on the road. Five youngsters, lounging on bikes, targeted the young woman and started following the slow-moving auto, making obscene gestures at her. 

She protested and warned the miscreants to stop following her. The gang then forced the auto to stop and surrounded it. Undaunted, the woman stepped out to face them. Enraged by her challenge, the five youths grabbed her and molested her. When she tried to fight back, they beat her up and snatched her necklace, an earring and mobile phone. The auto driver did nothing to help the woman as the miscreants went on beating and assaulting her. The ordeal went on for about 10 minutes until the local residents heard the commotion and ran to help. The gang, however, managed to escape.
