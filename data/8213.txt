Description:
			The pregnant girl discovered ablaze near a house at Lower Bazar in Ranchi on Sunday evening gave her statement to the police later at night based on which police on Monday lodged an FIR against her middle-aged lover and his wife for allegedly setting her on fire.

Sania Khan (22), who suffered 70 per cent burns, managed to tell police she had gone to the Tata Babu Lane home of her businessman lover Mahendra Jaiswal (47) on his invitation on Sunday. According to her, when she reached there, Mahendra was there with wife Reena and other family members. After a verbal altercation, "someone" threw "liquid" at her and set her ablaze.

Both Mahendra and Reena are missing from home.

Sania, who was taken to RIMS and shifted to Alam Hospital in Bariatu, is stable though substantially burnt from the waist up to her face.

Confessing to an affair with Mahendra, she said she had become pregnant last year too, after which the man forced her to undergo an abortion. However, as he promised to marry her, she kept up the relationship even though allegedly his wife Reena used to threaten her over phone, the girl added.

Lower Bazar thana in-charge Lalan Thakur said the Jaiswal couple had been booked under Sections 376 (rape), 307 (attempt to murder), 495 (adultery) and 312 (causing miscarriage) of the IPC.

Thakur said the girl, originally from Dharhara in Munger, Bihar, used to be a science student at Ranchi Women's College but became a dropout.
