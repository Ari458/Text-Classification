Rape
Description:
			A 57-year-old teacher of a Government school was arrested on charges of sexually assaulting an eight-year-old girl student.

Harikrishnan was arrested under Section 10 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act after the girl's parents along with residents of Irulanchanthai and Kirumambakkam villages staged a road roko seeking action against the teacher.

The parents had earlier approached the school authorities for action with the girl narrating the incident to them.

However, since the school authorities did not respond to their plea, the parents along with the villagers staged road roko protesting the inaction on the part of the school.

Director of School Education E Vallavan has ordered an inquiry into the incident.
