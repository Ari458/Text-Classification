Child Sexual Abuse, Crime, Rape
Description:
			A class nine student whose both the parents are working, was raped by her neighbour on the knife point. The incident took place in the first week of February.

The victim used to come home from school in the afternoon and even the accused used to come home for lunch. When he saw that she was alone, he forcibly entered the house and raped her. He then threatened her that if she would tell about it to anyone he will kill her and her parents.

The girl got scared and kept quiet for a few days and taking advantage of the girl's silence the accused raped her again. The third time when the accused raped her, the girl went to her friends place and asked for her mother's help. The mother when she came to know about the whole situation, she decided to lodge a police complaint, who was later arrested.

The girl is in class nine. She was threaten many times and as she was scared and could not talk about the incident to her parents, her friend helped out her with the issue.

There should be more awareness about the issue, normally people who are illiterate do not lodge complaint as they get scared if society comes to know about the issue, they will be ridiculed. Police are here to help, and unless and until anyone comes to lodge a complaint they cannot do anything. The acussed Abzoor aka Salman baba, 45, is under arrest and was produced in court.
