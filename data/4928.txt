Abduction, Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A city sessions court has held a youth guilty of abduction and rape of a minor girl and awarded him seven years of jail term. 

According to prosecutor Minal Bhatt, Shafiq Bashir Shaikh (24), who has migrated from Madhyapradesh and resides in Chandla Lake area of the city, was accused of kidnapping a 14-year old girl with purpose of forcing her into marriage and then raping her. Shaikh was tried for his alleged abduction of a minor living in the neighbourhood and taking her to Surat, where he allegedly raped her on February 18, 2012. 

A complaint in this regard was lodged by the girl's parents with the Isanpur police station. Shaikh was booked under sections 363, 366 and 376 of the Indian Penal Code. During his trial, prosecution examined 13 witnesses and submitted 17 documentary evidence before the sessions court. 


The prosecutor argued that the government has brought in a special legislation in Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO) to deal with such cases. She requested the court to hand over exemplary punishment to the accused so that a clear message is sent to the society. 

After hearing the argument, the additional sessions judge convicted Shaikh for three years for offences committed under section 363 ad 366 of IPC for kidnapping a minor girl with intention to compel her marriage, and seven year's term for rape.
