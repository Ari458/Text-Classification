Street Harassment
Description:
			Around 6.20 am on Saturday, three students were walking to their college in Malad when two boys on a motorcycle and brushed past them, making obscene gestures at the same time. As the girls screamed at them, the boys fled, only to return and attack one of them with a sharp object. 

In fact, the victim's friends did not even realize that she had been attacked. Only when she cried for help they turned around and noticed that she was injured. They, with the help of passersby, took her to a nearby hospital where she was administered five stitches. 

The police initially suspected that it was the fallout of a relationship gone sour. "But after going through the details, we have concluded that the roadside miscreants attacked the victim as they were angered when the girls protested and abused them," said senior inspector of Malad police station Avinash Jadhav. The Malad police have registered a complaint against the two unidentified youths and said they had never received any complaint of eve-teasing outside the college but from now on, they would keep a watch to nab the culprits.
