Street Harassment
Description:
			Two minor sisters aged 13 and 15 years were allegedly harassed by the conductor of a private bus said to be owned by an Akali leader in Muktsar district, their father said in a complaint to police last night.

The girls hailing from Kotli Sangar village in Muktsar district had come to the tehsil office here to get their Aadhaar cards made.

When they were on their way back on Wednesday evening, a conductor of a private bus allegedly started harassing them. They were asked to disembark from the vehicle at Kotkapura chowk after they confronted the conductor, their father said in his complaint.

On being contacted, Muktsar Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Kuldeep Singh Chahal today said that he had received a complaint in this regard and as per the guidelines of the Supreme Court, a case had been registered in this connection.

He, however, said that an investigation was under progress for necessary action.

Meanwhile, Punjab Students Union (PSU) activists staged demonstrations at Kotli Sangar village demanding action against the conductor and the bus owner.
