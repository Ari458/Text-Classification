Description:
			Nearly 120 people, including women, girls and children, were rescued from a protection home in Haryana's Rohtak town following a raid conducted by a team of the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR).
 
The raid was conducted by the NCPCR team at the Apna Ghar (child welfare house), Mahila-Aawas (women protection house) and the family consultation centre in Shri Nagar Colony here Wednesday night following complaints that the inmates were being harassed and physically abused.
 
The centres are being run by NGO, Bharat Vikas Sangh.
 
Interacting with the NCPCR team, the inmates of the protection home levelled serious allegations of physical, mental and sexual harassment and criminal intimidation against Jaswanti.
 
'We have checked the record of the NGO, living conditions and facilities being made available in the houses for the welfare of children and women. We have also talked to inmates who levelled various serious allegations against Jaswanti and her son-in-law Jai Bhagwan,' NCPCR member Vinod Tikko told media here.
 
He said three girl inmates, who had run away from the protection home three days back, had reported the happenings of the protection home to the National Women Rights Commission in Delhi.
