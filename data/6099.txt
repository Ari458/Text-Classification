Molestation, Street Harassment
Description:
			A tele-serial actress survived a rape attempt right in front of her house in south Kolkata after she returned from work on Sunday night. 

The 34-year-old alleges that though there were some bystanders nearby, no one bothered to help her. The goon escaped easily after snatching her mobile phone. She has filed a complaint of molestation and theft. The victim though has expressed her displeasure as the cops refused to register an attempt to rape case against her tormentors. 

The actress has told police that she returned home around 1.40 am after a late shoot at a Tollygunge studio. Her driver dropped her near the main gate of her residence and left. "She was going to unlock the collapsible gate when a man grabbed her from behind. He molested her and at one point she felt he was trying to physically assault her. The woman claimed that even though she raised an alarm, none of the bystanders watching the crime came forward to help. She managed to break free and tried to call the police emergency number. However, the attacker snatched her mobile phone and fled," said an investigating officer. 

She managed to contact Lalbazar control room and within five minutes police arrived. The case was handed to another police station after establishing that the crime took place in their jurisdiction. "We have registered a case under IPC sections of molestation, attempt to rape and theft and are investigating the case," said DC-south Suburban Santosh Pandey. Police are trying to record the survivor's statement at the earliest. 

The incident comes at a time when police are gearing up to stop crimes against women in the run-up to the New Year festivities. They encourage women to dial 1090 the helpline for women in distress  at the slightest hint of trouble. It is operated by the detective department.
