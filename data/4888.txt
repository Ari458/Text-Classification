Rape
Description:
			A 32-year-old woman was allegedly raped at Carambolim recently by a Phd student Kashinath Dhumaskar studying at Goa university and residing at Morjim.

The victim met the accused through a matrimonial site two months ago. Old Goa police have arrested the accused in the case.

Both the accused and victim are unmarried and were surfing the matrimonial site in search of a life partner. Police said that after becoming familiar on the matrimonial site they began meeting each other.

On May 25, both the accused and victim went to Carambolim to spend sometime with each other.

Suddenly the girl complained that she was feeling giddy and not feeling well.

The accused then took her to a nearby hotel and offered her something to eat as he believed that the giddiness was due to the girl being on an empty stomach, said police. Police said that later the accused booked a room in the same hotel and raped the girl.

Police said that the brother of the victim girl complained that Dhumaskar wrongfully restrained and confined his sister and sexually abused her without her consent.

The complainant also said that the accused clicked photos of his sister and demanded sexual favours from her. Police said after the victim refused to bow down to pressure from the accused, he threatened to post the same photos on social networking site and tarnish her image.

Old Goa police have registered the case under Section 341 (wrongful restraint), 342 (wrongful confinement), 376 ( rape), 506 (ii) (issuing threats) of Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Section 66 (e) of IT Act. Police inspector K P Sinari is further investigating the case.
