Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			An imitation jeweller was arrested by the Dindoshi police recently for the rape of a three-and-a-half year old girl. The accused, Pradeep Singh, 34 and the victim are neighbours.

The incident took place on Saturday afternoon. The victim lives with her parents and 18-year-old brother at Rani Sati Marg, Malad East. On Saturday afternoon, her brother stepped out with a friend and her mother went to the community tap to fill water. Around 1pm, the victim went to Singh's house to play.

"When her mother returned, she found the victim crying outside the house. She was in severe pain. Her mother checked the child's clothes and found that she was bleeding. She asked the victim who had assaulted her. The victim pointed towards Singh's house," a police official said.

By then the victim's brother had returned home. Her mother and brother took the victim to the Dindoshi police station. She was sent for a medical examination. Singh was later arrested.

"We have booked Singh under provisions of IPC and Protection of Children from Sexual offences Act. He was produced at the Dindoshi sessions court," said a police official.

Singh's lawyer, Sunny Wasker, said his client was being framed as the victim's family held a grudge against Singh's brother.
