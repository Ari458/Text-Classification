Child Sexual Abuse, Rape, Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			A nursery student of the Nirmala Convent School in Ujjain was allegedly raped by a bus conductor in a moving school vehicle earlier this week.

Police said that though the incident occurred on Monday, family members of the four-year-old girl filed a report at the Nanakhera police station only the next day. The complaint stated that the accused identified as Mahesh Bhagwan took advantage of the situation and sexually assaulted the girl after all the other students had been dropped off. The bus was plying from Alakhnanda Nagar to Vasant Vihar at the time.

The police have registered a case under Sections 354 (assault or criminal force with intent to outrage a woman's modesty), 376 (rape) and 325 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt) of the Indian Penal Code.

As the girl belongs to the scheduled caste, the case will be transferred to an Anusuchit Janjati Kalyan police station earmarked for the purpose.
