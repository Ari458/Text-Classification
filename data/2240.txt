Description:
			A man, who put a `chastity lock' on his wife in a cruel, self-devised way, was awarded 10 years' rigorous sentence by the court here today.

Additional Sessions Judge Avnindra Kumar Singh also imposed a fine of Rs 1,000 on the accused Sohanlal (38), a mechanic by profession.

According to the prosecution, Sohanlal, over four years, `locked' his wife's private parts everytime he left the home.

He had carried out a crude surgery on her to put the lock.

The suspicion of her character made him indulge in this bizarre cruelty, Public Prosecutor Jyoti Tomar told the court.

The woman suffered serious injuries in the process.

It came to light when the woman tried to end her life by consuming rat poison on July 16 last year. While treating her, a doctor at M Y Hospital found the lock and informed the police.

Dr Vibha Moses, who examined the woman, told the court that she had found the lock on woman's private parts, and the woman told her that her husband had fixed it four years ago, after forcing her to eat opium for anesthetic effect.

Interestingly, though the victim retracted her statement during the trial, the judge relied on the doctor's statement and the circumstantial evidence to convict Sohanlal, advocate Tomar said.
