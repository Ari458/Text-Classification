Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A 16-year-old boy was apprehended on Saturday for allegedly raping a six-year-old girl who lives in his neighbourhood in Vishnu Garden. The girl, whose private parts were injured during the sexual assault, was rushed to Safdurjung Hospital in Delhi and is reported to be stable now. The accused has been sent to a juvenile home in Faridabad, said police.

According to police, the girl lives with her parents, who are labourers. On Saturday evening, the girl's father was at work while her mother had returned home. Around 4pm, when her mother went out to fetch water, the girl too ventured out into the lane.

She met the accused, who also lives in the same neighbourhood. The teenager allegedly lured her to go along with him and took her to his house."He then raped her and threatened to kill her if she told anyone about it. He then dropped her off near her residence around 5pm. The child was bleeding when she reached home. Her mother realised she has been sexually assaulted," ACP Hawa Singh said.

The girl could identify the accused's home, and her mother raised an alarm when they reached there. The neighbours nabbed the teenager and the parents informed police about the incident. Cops said the accused and his father are vegetable vendors. He was alone at home as his parents had gone to their hometown in Bihar. The teenager was apprehended on Saturday. The girl and the accused were taken to Civil Hospital for medical examination. Tests revealed the child has suffered severe injuries in her private parts.

An case has been lodged under POCSO (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) Act and sections 506 (criminal intimidation) and 365 (kidnapping) of the IPC.
