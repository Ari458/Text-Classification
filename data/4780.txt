Molestation
Description:
			A woman employee in her late 20s working with an NGO based at Sapru Marg has accused her senior of sexual harassment. She approached Hazratganj police to lodge a complaint against Muntazir Mehendi, office in charge of the NGO (Sansar Samajik Sansthan) that has its office inside Dilipur Tower.

The woman was near Janpath market on Wednesday morning and asked Mehendi to collect office belongings. The accused, allegedly, tried to hold complainant's hand forcibly and dragged her towards the motorcycle.

As her friends intervened, Mehendi along with three more youths identified as Lav, Ashish and Manoj bashed up Rajeev Saroj, a postgraduate medical student. Mehendi also sustained some injuries in the melee.

The complainant and her friends later submitted a complaint to the police and a case under causing hurt voluntarily, intentional insult and criminal intimidation was registered against the violent group. Mehendi denying the charges maintained that it was the other side which started misbehaving. The complainant alleged that Mehendi was married but was mounting pressure on her to get into a relationship which is why she decided to leave the job.
