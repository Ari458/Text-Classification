			A 16-year-old girl was allegedly molested in outer Delhi Narela on Tuesday. Her father claimed that two men forcibly gained entry into the house and tried to rape her at knife-point.

The girl's father told Deccan Herald that the incident occurred when she was going to a washroom on the balcony of the house.

He identified the accused as Rizwan and his brother-in-law Aadab, and claimed that Aadab's father is a local goon named Yakoob.

Rizwan and Aadab were allegedly standing outside the house when they saw the girl around 3.45 am.

They entered into the house and threatened my daughter at knife-point. She was taken to a room where the two men tried to rape her,the girls father said.

Her family members, however, rushed to help on hearing her cry for help. Hearing the commotion, their neighbours also gathered outside the house.

Rizwan and Aadab tried to flee, but locals managed to overpower Aadab. Rizwan fled by jumping over the fence, the girl's father added.

Aadab was also thrashed by locals before being handed over to police.

Goon bribed police

A case of molestation under Indian Penal Code and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act has been filed.

The girl's statement was recorded in Rohini Court on Wednesday. Aadab was also produced before the court and sent to judical custody.
