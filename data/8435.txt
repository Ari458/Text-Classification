Description:
			A 16-year-old Dalit plus-one student was assaulted by a man and his son, a student of the same school, for allegedly crossing his legs at school.

According to the police, the alleged incident took place during the parent-teacher association (PTA) meeting at the Madura Sugar Higher Secondary School in Vadipatti on Tuesday.

The police said that the father of a caste Hindu student, Murugesan, who had come to attend the meeting took offence after witnessing a Dalit student sitting cross-legged near them and asked his son to call the boy. He shouted at him for daring to cross his legs in front of caste Hindus.

The Dalit boy remained unapologetic, following which the Caste Hindu family, including the boy, allegedly assaulted him. The Dalit student's father, Kannan, who was also present rushed to his son's aid. Later, they lodged a complaint with Vadapatti Police.

The repercussion was felt the next day, when the Caste Hindu student from Nelakottai in Dindigul district got down near the school from a bus and the Dalit boy and his father, who were waiting for him allegedly assaulted him with a wooden log. He was rescued by the locals. A counter case was filed with Vadipatti Police. There is tension in the area after the two incidents.

A senior police officer said that they will conduct a peace meeting with the parents and students of both communities. They have also advised teachers to inculcate a sense of communal harmony.
