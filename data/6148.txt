Rape
Description:
			A woman from West Bengal was gangraped by five men, including a driver of a senior administrative official, in district collectorate premises in Bihar's Muzaffarpur district, a police officer said today.

Five men, including the driver of an Additional District Magistrate lured the 30 year-old to come with her on the promise of dropping her to her brother in-law's house in neighbouring Sitamarhi district, but took her to the district collectorate premise where they gangraped her, Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Ranjeet Kumar Mishra said.

The woman somehow managed to free herself from their clutches and went to the nearby police station for help, he said.

A case has been registered against five accused persons, identified as the ADM's driver Niku Pandit, Jitendra Paswan, Vikas Tiwari, Gautam Jha and Deepak Kumar, Mishra said, adding that Pandit has been arrested even as raids were being carried out to nab others.

The woman has been taken to the Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH) for medical examination, the SSP said.
