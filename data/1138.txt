Rape
Description:
			In a rape case of a 7 year old girl in 2007 near Ponda, the high court of Bombay at Goa on Thursday reduced the sentence of life imprisonment imposed on Dhannaram Bhill, 19, by the children's court considering the young age of the accused, deterioration of his mental condition soon after the commission of the offence, that there are no criminal antecedents, that there was slight penetration and the fact that life imprisonment is not compulsory, we are of the view that in this case, the sentence of life imprisonment should be reduced to that of rigorous imprisonment for 12 years."
