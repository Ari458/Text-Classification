Dowry Harassment
Description:
			Jayanthi (27) a resident of Gonder Street at Rathinpuri here, was married to Roobas (32), a resident of Mudis in Valparai, five years ago. Jayanthi's parents had given 50 sovereigns of gold and Rs 1 lakh in cash as dowry at the time of marriage. 

In the complaint, Jayanthi had said that her parents gave another Rs 3.5 lakh to Roobas for his education and another Rs 2 lakh to purchase a car. About a year and a half ago, Jayanthi left her husband after he harassed and beat her in a drunken state.
