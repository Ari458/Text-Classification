Rape
Description:
			Sandeep Kohli, the proprietor of Kohli Brothers, a prominent apparel store in Lucknow, has gone 'underground' after he was accused of raping an acquaintance's daughter. The incident took place on the intervening night of February 13-14 in Delhi.

The survivor, currently a student in Delhi, has also lodged an FIR against him. A senior police official confirmed that an FIR against Kohli has been lodged at Chanakyapuri police station on February 19, 2014. The survivor has also been put through a medical examination, following which she has recorded her official statement before the chief judicial magistrate. Kohli and his wife are at large.

Kohli called the survivor after reaching New Delhi on February 13 and asked the girl to meet him.

This was a person well known to and trusted by the girl's family. Therefore, there was no reason to doubt his intentions. She was busy, but upon his insistence, she agreed to meet him. Police probing the case have managed to get the CCTV footage showing both the accused and the survivor at the hotel where the crime was committed.

Following the complaint, a team of Delhi police officials visited Lucknow on February 22. However, Kohli and his wife were found missing.

His mother and two sons, who were at home when the team visited, could not confirm his whereabouts. The Aliganj police station has been alerted and the police are currently probing the case.
