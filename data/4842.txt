Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A three-year-old girl was allegedly raped by a cycle mechanic on Wednesday in Balod district. The accused was arrested after he was caught and thrashed by locals. To add to the woes, the victim's family had to run from pillar to post for her medical examination so that rape could be confirmed.

The victim and her six-year-old brother, residents of Bade Jangura village had gone to the cycle repair shop where accused Deenbandhu, 27, worked. After the repair work, her brother went back leaving her alone playing near the shop, police said. On finding the girl alone, Deenbandhu took her inside his house and sexually assaulted her.

On reaching home, she complained of pain in her private parts to her mother and her parents immediately reported the matter to the police. Victim and her family had a tough time getting the girl medically examined as the facility is not available in the village hospital.

Police said she was then shifted to Balod district hospital, but due to absence of a gynaecologist, the survivor was taken to Gunderdehi hospital. Unfortunately, the gynaecologist there, citing few reasons referred her to Durg hospital. The victim was being taken to Durg when last reports came in. Accused was booked under sections of IPC and Protection of Child from Sexual Offences Act.
