Child Sexual Abuse, Molestation, Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			The headmaster of a government school at Siddalingapura on the outskirts of the city was thrashed by village residents and handed over to the police for alleged sexual harassment of a student, on Wednesday.

The accused, Ramamurthy (58), headmaster of the Government Senior Primary School, is a resident of the adjoining village of Naganahalli.

He allegedly used to harass a 12-year-old girl studying in the sixth standard and had warned her against telling her parents. The harassment continued until the girl gathered enough courage to tell her parents, who were so enraged that they went to the school on Wednesday morning, along with local residents.

The headmaster was thrashed by them before the Metagalli police reached the school.

The headmaster was then taken into custody.

He was beaten up and has some injuries. He is being questioned, said the Metagalli police.
