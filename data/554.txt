Rape
Description:
			A 17-year-old girl was killed in Nakodar by her mother and brother, after she refused to part ways with a boy, with whom she had an affair. The accused initially tried to project it as a case of electrocution, but a neighbour woman, who smelt a rat in the case, informed police, who found it to be a case of murder.

Deceased Simran reportedly had an affair with one Lakshman, over which her mother Sinder Kaur and brother Lovepreet (20) were admonishing her. They had asked her to discontinue the affair or else she could face serious consequences, sources said.
