Rape
Description:
			The Kottarakkara police registered a case against two youths on charge of raping a dalit minor girl. 

According to the police, the 16-year-old girl had been subjected to abuse by her own father since the age of 13. This was revealed in a counselling session held at her school last year. Following this, she was shifted to the Mahila Samakhya Society in Thiruvananthapuram. She was brought back to her home on Sunday as her class 11 examination was scheduled to begin on Monday. On Sunday night, her father came home drunk and tried to rape her. The girl, who ran out of the home, landed in the hands of the accused, who were having a booze party in their truck.
