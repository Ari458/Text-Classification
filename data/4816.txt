Dowry Harassment
Description:
			TV actor Shobhit Attray, who has performed in Hindi serials like "Na Aana Is Des Laado", was sent in one-day police remand on Sunday, after his wife accused him of dowry harassment. The actor's wife, Nisha, has also accused his brother-in-law of sexual harassment. Haryana police picked up the actor from his Meerut residence on Saturday and produced in a court here a day later. Shobhit is set to make his debut in movies with "Tere Ishq Mein". Police sources claimed that Shobhit's arrest was as dramatic as the plots of his TV serials. A large crowd of fans and relatives gheraoed the actor's house when police reached there and a battery of lawyers tried to intervene and stop his arrest. When police insisted on taking Shobhit in, his father Vijender pulled out a revolver, threatening that he wouldn't allow anyone to take his son away. Nisha, who is from Yamunanagar, has alleged that the actor harassed her for dowry. Apart from Shobhit, three members of his family have also been booked, including husband of Shobhit's sister Amit from Mumbai. An engineering graduate and a resident of Labour Colony, Jagadhri, Nisha tied the knot with Shobhit in January 2012. In her complaint to police, she alleged that soon after their marriage, Shobhit started harassing her for not fulfilling his demand for more dowry. "He took me along to Mumbai only once and started torturing me after a few days. When I resisted, he sent me back to my in-laws' house, who further harassed me. At last, I returned to my parents' house. After elders in my family intervened, he stopped harassing me for a while but that didn't last long," said Nisha, mother of a one-year-old boy, in her police statement.
