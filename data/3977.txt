Molestation
Description:
			Three FIRs have been lodged against a judge of labour court here for allegedly molesting his female colleague and for consumption and possession of liquor.

While one of the FIRs was lodged under the Indian Penal Code (IPC), the remaining two were lodged under the Gujarat Prohibition Act.

According to police, labour court judge D S Chaudhary had been harassing his female typist for the last three months.

The girl, a resident of Malanpada village in Valsad district, had told her parents about it.

Yesterday, as the girl was returning home after getting down from the bus with her father on a two-wheeler, the judge, who was on leave from Monday, followed her to her village.

According to police, the girl's father warned the judge but when he didn't relent, villagers gathered and thrashed him and handed him over to police.

Police also found a beer bottle in his car at the time of incident, due to which case under prohibition laws was also lodged against him.

Since as per the Supreme Court guidelines, if a judge (Class-I officer) has to be arrested, permission has to be sought from High Court, the local police have initiated the process to arrest him.
