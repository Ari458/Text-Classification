Rape
Description:
			An auto-rickshaw driver was sentenced
to life imprisonment by a local court for raping a mentally challenged girl.
 Nandlal Yadav (28), the accused, knew that the victim was mentally challenged. In March 2008, he found her alone and induced her to go to a nearby lodge.
    
After raping her there, he left the girl on the road. While he was fleeing, she pointed to his rickshaw when some rickshaw drivers saw her and asked her what was the matter.
    
One of them noted registration number of Yadav's rickshaw and informed the police. Police tracked him down with the help
of local auto-rickshaw union members.
    
During trial, the prosecution examined 15 witnesses.
     
Accepting the prosecution's case, the sessions court convicted him.
