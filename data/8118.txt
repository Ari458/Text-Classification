Murder
Description:
			The steel city and its adjoining areas were jolted by two murders, including that of a 40-year-old widow with three children, on Thursday.

While the woman was found dead in a pool of blood near her house at Adityapur in Seraikela-Kharsawan district at 6am, a 23-year-old tractor driver from Belajuri in Jamshedpur, who was attacked by his employer's son and nephew on Wednesday night for allegedly making an obscene remark about the former's 50-year-old wife, succumbed to his injuries while being taken to hospital by police around 8am.

Sonamati Kui (40), a resident of Jagannathpur in Adityapur in Gamharia police station area, was allegedly hacked to death by her 25-year-old lover Rabi Hansda in the wee hours.

When the victim's children - the eldest is 18-year-old boy Subhas Kui - came to know about the murder of their mother, they informed Adityapur police.

But as the area falls between Adityapur and Gamharia, police reached late.

Officer-in-charge (OC) of Gamharia police station Adikan Mahto said from the statements of Subhas's son, it was clear that the widow had an affair with Rabi.

"She has been pressing Rabi, also a resident of Jagannathpur, of marrying her. This might have prompted him to kill her. Rabi is at large. We have registered a murder case against him," Mahto told The Telegraph.

Police have recovered the body and sent it to MGM Medical College for post-mortem.
