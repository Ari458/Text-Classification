Rape
Description:
			16-year-old girl Mona (name changed) from the South Gopal Chandi area in West Bengal was forced into prostitution by her boyfriend, who she fell in love with after she returned his numerous missed calls on her mobile phone.

On November 9, Mulla reportedly popped the question to Mona. Accused told her to come to Barasat railway station in West Bengal.

The girl left home saying she was going to visit a friend. Mulla told Mona that they would stay for a few days at his uncle’s place in Sialda and then would leave for Mumbai, where they would get married.

On November 13, Mulla brought Mona to Mumbai and introduced her to one Meena, who runs a prostitution racket. Mona was raped by about 16 people on several occasions at different places, the police said. The police are checking if Mulla had conned other girls in a similar way and forced them into prostitution.
