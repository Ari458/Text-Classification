Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			Two Radio Jockeys (RJs), who got married against the wishes of their parents, have been sacked from their jobs. No, they have not been sacked because of their inter-caste marriage, but for their complaint against one senior employee. The couple hurled sexual harassment allegation against one senior employee and were shown the door.

The incident took place at All India Radio (AIR). The couple claimed that Local Radio Station (LRS) 102.5 FM's Programme Executive harassed the woman sexually. An internal sexual harassment committee was set up to investigate the allegations against the senior employee of AIR. The couple, however, claimed that they were not informed about the findings of the probe.

The woman, who joined AIR's Rainbow FM at Chennai in 2004 and later shifted to Dharampuri after her marriage, was quoted as saying, "From the beginning the Programme Executive began passing sexually explicit comments at me. He would ask me to call him on the phone at night." "Whenever we met in office, he would look at me inappropriately. I stopped interacting with him and informed my husband who also works as a casual announcer. In February, Murali threatened to sack me if I did not cooperate' with him," she added. Meanwhile, the accused, who is a physically challenged person, claimed that allegations against him were not true and the couple was sacked for furnishing false residential address.

Now, the couple filed a complaint with the AIR Additional Director and the internal sexual harassment committee. The husband of the woman claimed that the accused has been enjoying sympathy over his physical disabilities.
