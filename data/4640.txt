Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A youth has been jailed for seven years by a Delhi court for raping a 11-year-old girl after giving her a sedative-laced tea in his house. 

Additional Sessions Judge Virender Bhat awarded the jail term to Dwarka resident Ajay Kumar Sonar holding him guilty of the offences of rape, causing hurt by means of poison, criminal intimidation and voluntarily causing hurt under the IPC. 

The court convicted Sonar even though the minor had turned hostile and observed that the girl was won over by him. 

"It cannot be gainsaid that rape is one of the most hated and most serious crimes prevalent in the society. In fact, there should be no place for the offence of rape in civilised society. It is the most violent and barbaric attack upon the person and psychology of the victim, which can happen to her in her life time. 

"The need of the hour is to deal sternly with the perpetrators of such odious and brutal crimes. In the instant case, I do not find any mitigating factors on record which may persuade this court to impose any lenient sentence upon the convict (Sonar)," the judge said. 

The court also imposed a fine of Rs 15,000 on Sonar, who was in a government job. 

The court said it appeared that the act of Sonar was "well deliberated upon and well planned". 

Sonar and the minor knew each other as he used to live near her house and with trust, her mother used to send the child with him to hospital for treatment as she was suffering from eczema. 

Due to the disease, the girl could not walk properly. 

According to the prosecution, in August 2012, Sonar took the girl to the hospital for treatment and after taking her medicines, he took the minor to his quarters on the pretext of having tea. 

He gave her a sedatives-laced tea after which she became unconscious and he raped her.
