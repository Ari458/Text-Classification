Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A teenager was allegedly abducted and gangraped by two of her neighbours in northwest Delhi's Timarpur area today, police said.

The two accused, identified as Kapil (24) and Kishan (22), have been arrested after a police constable on patrol caught them in the act in the afternoon today.

According to police, the 16-year-old girl had gone to the market when the two accused, said to be labourers living close to her home, abducted her and took her to an isolated place, where they took turns to rape her.

As the girl cried out for help, a police constable who was patrolling nearby reached the spot and nabbed one of the accused. He then alerted his colleagues who apprehended the other accused.
