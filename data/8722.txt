			A juvenile and his friend were booked by the Ambala police on Tuesday for allegedly raping a 16-year-old girl, who worked as a domestic help at his house. 

A case of poisoning and sexual abuse under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act has been registered at local police station following a complaint from the girl's father, who is a migrant labourer. According to the complaint, the duo had given the girl some drug-laced drink at his home and raped her on October 24.

"The girl is unfit to give her statement. The case has been registered on the statement of the victim's father," said SHO inspector Vijay Kumar. According to sources, medical examination has confirmed rape. He added that the police were making efforts to nab the two accused in the case.
