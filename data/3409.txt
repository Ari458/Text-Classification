Description:
			A city-based photographer has been arrested for allegedly attempting to rape an aspiring model. Though the crime was committed in April last year, the girl lodged a complaint recently as the accused had her photographs. She alleged that he tried to rape her by luring her with promises of glittering career. 

The girl belonging to a dalit family has also alleged that the accused, Bhavin Savaliya alias Raj Desai, even passed casteist remarks against her after she refused to yield to his overtures. The crime was allegedly committed in April last year when the girl was struggling to get modelling assignments. 

As the model refused to surrender to his demands, the photographer threatened the victim and started sharing her photographs on social media sites like facebook and youtube. He threatened to load her obscene photographs on the internet. Investigations revealed that he possessed such photos. 

The 27-year-old girl was shown dreams of becoming a top model by Savaliya. The struggling model was in search of work when the accused met her through a social networking site in early 2012. Convinced by his offers she agreed for photo shoots that were done during April 2012 at Savaliyas studio. Savaliya allegedly took her obscene photographs. She has alleged that while showing her photos the accused often touched her. Thereafter, he allegedly attempted to convince the victim for physical relations and tried to rape her in his studio in Tulsi Market. The victim opposed Savaliya strongly following which he told her that she cannot become a model since she is of a specific caste and threatened to kill her. 

The victim came in touch with the accused through a common online friend. Savaliya allegedly committed the crime in April 2012 but he kept the photographs with him. The victim feared that he may use it to malign her image.
