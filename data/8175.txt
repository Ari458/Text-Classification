Domestic Violence, Dowry Harassment
Description:
			A 25-year-old woman jumped off Tipu Drop atop Nandi Hills with her two-year-old son on Friday due to alleged dowry harassment.

Prateeksha, a homemaker, married Suman, a businessman from Bagepalli, four years ago. The police said that Prateeksha left home with her son Sathvik on Friday claiming to meet her friend. After removing her slippers, she jumped off Tipu Drop with Sathvik, the police said. 

On Saturday, a group of people, who were visiting Tipu Drop, found something amiss after noticing the slippers and informed the police. The Chickballapur rural police recovered Prateeksha's body after several hours. They are yet to find Sathvik's body. A senior police official said that Prateeksha was identified based on a missing complaint filed by her parents. Her father Nagaraju rushed to Chickballapur to receive her body. However, he accused her in-laws of dowry harassment and physical torture. Based on his complaint, the police have registered a case of dowry death against Suman, who is presently on the run.
