Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			Two brothers in Bilaspur's Pendra region were arrested late on Friday on charges against gang-raping a minor girl residing in the neighbourhood on Thursday night. 

According to Pendra police, the accused were relatives of minor girl whom they had abducted from her house at around 11 pm when she was sleeping. 

According to statement of 16-year-old girl, the alleged accused Ramkishan and Khemchand Sumer had stuffed her mouth with a cloth and dragged her to a nearby isolated field and took turns to rape her. 

Further, they threatened her of dire consequences if she revealed the incident to anyone and left her alone in the fields in injured state. 

While she somehow managed to return home by dawn, she narrated the story to her family soon after which an FIR was lodged and accused were arrested on Saturday at Kotmi police station. 

Police said that it looked like a case of revenge as the girl's mother had a fight with the relatives the same day and she had left for some place, leaving the girl alone in house. "The duo took advantage of her loneliness and attempted to take revenge from girl's mother by raping her," Pendra inspector in charge Kamlesh Singh Thakur said. 

Prima facie indicates that the duo were brothers of girl's mother. 

He said that the accused were arrested under Section of Protection of Children Against Sexual Offences Act and 363 and 376 under IPC.
