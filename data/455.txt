Child Sexual Abuse, Murder, Rape
Description:
			The Sampigehalli police arrested Anil Kumar (29) on Thursday night on the charge of raping and killing a seven-year-old girl in Mirle village in K.R. Nagar taluk of Mysore on April 30 this year.

The accused, who is in police custody after the court rejected his bail plea, is said to have confessed he killed the child when she screamed during the rape.

He is our neighbour and we trusted him, the girl's inconsolable mother, who is an anganwadi assistant in Mirle, told The Hindu.

A relative said Anil was unwell and the child wanted to help him. She went to his house when he asked her to bring some pills from a nearby shop.

Anil reportedly told the police he had taken the child to a nearby sugarcane field after promising her jaggery and copra. He had killed her, he said, as he feared exposure.
