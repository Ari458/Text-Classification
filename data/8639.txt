Molestation
Description:
			A 32-year-old designer working for an advertising agency in Chembur, who was arrested on Tuesday for allegedly molesting a woman lawyer on the foot overbridge at the Panvel station six days ago, has been released on bail. However, to ensure that the accused does not repeat the offence, the Panvel GRP will now summon him to sign a bond promising his good behaviour.

Panvel GRP senior inspector Prakash Kirdutt said, "In case of offences like molestation, the assistant commissioner of police can make the accused sign a bond for good conduct, at least for a year, as a preventive measure."
Kirdutt said, "On July 21, the man allegedly stalked her and touched her inappropriately. She tried to catch him but he fled. On July 25, she lodged a complaint with the GRP. We scanned the CCTV footage and saw the woman confronting the man. A trap was laid on Tuesday. The man was spotted again and he tried to get close to the woman. The cops immediately caught him."
