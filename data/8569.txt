Street Harassment
Description:
			It was her evening walk home from the gym that quickly turned into a nightmare last Friday when 27-year-old Megha (name changed) was allegedly eve-teased and molested by three unidentified miscreants on a bike in HSR Layout.

The incident is said to have occurred around 8pm in HSR Layout Sector I, when the victim, who works at a private tech firm, was walking home with a friend. 

"It happened so suddenly that I didn't know how to react at first. We were on the road near the Sai Baba temple when the youths went past us on a bike and slowed down. They made some nasty comments and one of them grabbed me from behind. Even as I screamed in anger, they sped away laughing. My friend and I began chasing them and got to the next road, where we nearly caught up with them, but they escaped," Megha told Mirror.

Though stunned, the women quickly gathered their wits and gave chase. The miscreants, who were caught unawares, stopped briefly on the road but managed to flee just when the women reached them.

"In the meanwhile, passers-by gathered near us and one of them sent me a photograph of the licence plate of the youth's bike (KA-03-JD-3594) that they had managed to click. I was going out of town for the weekend, but went to the HSR Layout police station anyway and informed them of the incident. They noted down the licence plate number in the register, but it was not until Tuesday when I visited the station that an FIR was registered," the victim added.

The victim, who is a resident of HSR Layout Sector VII, suspects that the youths are locals. The HSR Layout police, meanwhile, confirmed that a case had been registered and said that the miscreants would be caught soon.
