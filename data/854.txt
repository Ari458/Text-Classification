Abuse
Description:
			The Accused is an alcoholic and had used the opportunity when his wife and son were not there to take advantage of his own daughter. The details of the incident are too graphic, so i am not going to write them here. There is a full article link provided with the report.

After being tortured thus for almost a year , the girl then narrated the incident to her mother, who confronted the accused, who refused that any such thing had happened. Finally, she told about it to her uncle, who then persuaded her to register a complaint. 

"I cried and resisted but my father smothered my mouth. He threatened to beat me if I went and told it to my mother or anyone else," the frail-looking girl told the police while registering her complaint at the Versova police station on Sunday evening.
