Abuse
Description:
			Three years ago, Manohar(29), who is an MBBS Graduate became friends with a software engineer from Hyderabad. The phone friendship continued for about a year but when the doctor finally proposed, the girl rejected his proposal.

Enraged with the rejection, Manohar began abusing her over the phone. He also started sending abusive SMSs and emails to harass the woman. Finally a year-and-half ago, she got married and left for the United States. At that time, Manohar created fake profiles of the victim on social networking site, Orkut, using obscene photo graphs and description.
