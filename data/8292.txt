Child Sexual Abuse, Molestation, Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			Acting on the complaint of the Child Welfare Committee (CWC), police filed a case, against a lecturer of the Government Women’s Polytechnic College in Lawspet here, under sections of the POSCO Act for allegedly making sexual advances towards girl students including minors.

Lawspet police Sub-inspector Ilango said that a case has been registered against lecturer Karunagaran, employed in one of the college’s departments, under Section 11 (Sexual Harassment of the Child) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO), as well as Sections 509 (Word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) and 354 (Assault or criminal force of woman with intent to outrage her modesty).

The lecturer had allegedly misbehaved with girls, including minors.

The minor victims submitted a complaint to the Child Welfare Committee, whose officials made enquiries and recorded statements of the victims.

Following this, the CWC, formally lodged a complaint with the Inspector-General of Police (IGP) against the lecturer.

Based on the complaint, the IGP ordered that action be taken against the accused.

Last week, students staged an agitation by picketing the office of the Puducherry Institute of Post-matric Technical Education (PIPMATE) seeking action against the lecturer.

The agitating students met M Mansoor, Director of PIPMATE, who assured the students that immediate action would be taken against the accused lecturer after which the agitating students dispersed.

Girls students  too approached the director of PIPMATE after the Principal of their college failed to take necessary action despite a complaint lodged in this regard.

The lecturer has since been transferred to Yanam, one of the outlying regions of the Union Territory.
