Rape
Description:
			The Cantonment All Women Police has registered a rape case against an inspector of police on a complaint from a woman. The police have decided to conduct an enquiry with the inspector, Murugesan, who is now serving in Tirunelveli district.

The inspector had served in the Social Justice and Human Rights unit in Tiruchi city before his transfer to Tirunelveli district. The complainant, Parimala, an acquaintance of the inspector, is said to have given him some money, according to police sources.

The money is said to have been given after the inspector was trapped by the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti Corruption, Tiruchi unit, in a corruption case a few years ago. The inspector, who was serving as the Station House Officer of Airport police station at the time, was placed under suspension following his arrest on the bribe charge.

Misunderstanding broke out between the inspector and the woman when the latter asked him to repay the money she had given him.

Parimala in her complaint alleged that the inspector had raped her in her house here a few days ago and left the spot.

On the basis of the complaint, the Cantonment All Women Police booked a case against the inspector under IPC section 417 (cheating) and 376 (rape).
