Rape
Description:
			On a day that the Rajya Sabha passed the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Bill, reducing the age of juveniles who can be prosecuted for criminal offences from 18 to 16, police in Madurantakam, about 70km from Chennai, arrested three people, including a 16-year-old boy, for the gang-rape of a 21-year-old woman on December 11.

On the day of the crime, police said, the woman had taken her cattle to the field to graze when the trio gagged and dragged her into a clump of bushes where they sexually assaulted her. Police identified two of the arrested as Kamal, 25, and Nagaraj, 26, daily wage workers from Thandalam near Cheyyur in Madurantakam. The juvenile was employed in an eatery in the same neighbourhood.

Preliminary inquiries revealed that the woman was with her cattle in the fields when the three men pounced on her. After they had satiated their lust, they dumped her on the banks of a lake and escaped. The woman woke up after some time and returned home with her cattle. She told her husband and parents about the incident and then lodged a police complaint.

Based on the details of the profile of the men, police got their portraits drawn on a computer using Auto-Cad software. The victim knew one of her assailants and told police about him. A special team of the Madurantakam police nabbed Kamal and Nagaraj and later picked up their 16-year-old partner in crime.

A case was registered under IPC Sections 342 (wrongful confinement), 376 (rape), 307 (attempt to murder) and arrested the trio. A Chengalpet magistrate's court sent Kamal and Nagaraj to jail, while the minor was produced before the juvenile justice board in Kellys, Chennai and admitted to the juvenile home there.
