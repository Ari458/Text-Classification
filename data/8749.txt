Murder
Description:
			The body of an unidentified woman, in her 20s, was found in a bush near NH-24 on Monday afternoon.

According to police, the body was found in a decomposed state apparently dumped more than a month ago and the face completely crushed. Police have not ruled out the possibility of a sexual assault as only the upper portion of the body was covered in clothes. The body has been sent to Lal Bahadur Shastri hospital for an autopsy.

A dupatta was tied around the woman's mouth and a wire had been used to strangle her, police said. Her hands and feet were also tied with a metal wire that had cut into her skin.

Police said that the woman might have been murdered elsewhere and the body dumped at the spot. Police have sent the clothes for forensic analysis.

Local residents had complained about a foul smell coming from the area and informed the police. A team from the Pandav Nagar police station reached the spot and found the body.

Preliminary investigations suggest that the woman had been tortured before being murdered. Police have recovered a few other items, including some torn papers, from the spot that could lead to clues about her death.

The woman was about five-feet tall, had a wheatish complexion and was wearing a white salwar suit at the time of the murder. Officers said that they were going through reports of women who had gone missing in the city in the last five days.
