Rape
Description:
			An 18-year-old girl has accused her boyfriend and two others of raping her in the city's Jalukbari area. City Police have registered a case and all the three accused have been arrested and are being quizzed.

The three accused have been identified as Imran Hussain, Nurzamal Haque and Hafizur Rahma. The rape survivor and the accused are from the Barpeta district of western Assam. The girl is currently undergoing medical tests.

According to the survivor, her boyfriend, Imran, asked her to come to Guwahati on the clever pretext of marriage. She ran from her home in Barpeta district and arrived in the city. But instead of her lover, two of his friends - Nurzamal Haque and Hafizur Rahman - received her at the bus stop and took her to Nurzamal's house saying Imran was on his way.

She knew Nurzamal, an auto-rickshaw driver in the city, and so did not hesitate to go with him. She fainted after drinking a glass of water at his rented room. Later, when she regained consciousness, she realized that she had been drugged and raped.

The GMCH authorities said her condition was stable.

She informed police that she was in relationship with Imran for the last four years and the couple was planning to get married. Imran, who hails from the survivor's village, is a vegetable seller in the city.

Police have to verify the medical reports with the charges first.
