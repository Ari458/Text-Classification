Description:
			A man killed his daughters aged between 2 to 9 years due to financial crisis and threw the bodies into a canal near Mangrol village in Jalalpor tehsil of Navsari district.

Sanjay Dubey, who hails from Uttar Pradesh and lives in Pandesara area here, strangulated his three daughters today. He then threw the bodies into a canal off Ubhrat-Maroli road near Mangrol, said inspector Mahendra Kher.

The victims were identified as Akanskha (9), Priya (7) and the youngest Bhavna (2), Kher said, adding the police had arrested Dubey under Indian Penal Code sections 302 (murder) and 201 (destruction of evidence) on the basis of a complaint by Dubey's younger brother Dhananjay.

Dubey told the police that his financial situation had become difficult, and he wanted a son instead of three daughters, which led him to commit the gruesome act.

Last evening he told his wife that he was taking the girls out for a fun-fair and shopping in the city. When they did not return till late, she approached the police.

The sarpanch of Mangrol spotted the bodies today and alerted the police who fished them out. Bodies has been sent for autopsy and further probe is on, Kher said.
