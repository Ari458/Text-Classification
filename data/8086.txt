Rape
Description:
			A 19-year-old woman was raped allegedly by the driver of a mini-bus she had boarded at Soolibele, on the outskirts of the city, to go to work in a hospital in Hoskote on Thursday morning. It was only on October 5 that a call-centre employee was gang-raped in HSR Layout in the city.

In the latest case, the driver, Ravi, 21, offered the woman a lift and she was the sole passenger. Ravi handed over controls to his assistant, Manjunath, and raped her. Her ordeal continued for more than an hour. The accused later left her at Hoskote and sped away. The shocked victim went to the hospital and by afternoon, narrated her ordeal to her colleagues, who alerted the Soolibele police.

A case has been filed.

The police tracked down the mini-bus using the details given by the victim and arrested, Ravi, who is from Shivamogga, and Manjunath, 24, from Chintamani, on Friday morning.

A medical examination of the victim confirmed rape.

The police have sent the accused for a medical examination and taken them into custody.

The mini-bus belonged to one Krishnamurthy from Hoskote and was intercepted while ferrying employees of a garment factory. Ravi had been working as the driver for the past one year, and Manjunath had joined as his assistant just 10 days ago.

The bus did not have the permit to ferry passengers. Though the mini-bus had the permit to ferry garment factory employees, it was plying illegally on the routes to ferry passengers. The bus seized has violated the permit condition and breached the contract carriage permit, senior transport officials said.
