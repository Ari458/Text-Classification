			A 20-year-old married woman from Karnataka was sold in New Delhi for Rs 1 lakh a week ago by a human trafficking gang and raped by her buyer who kept her at his house, said police on Monday.
The incident was reported to Ghazipur police station in east Delhi January 9 when the victim managed to flee from the clutches of the accused, identified as Zakir, who bought her from a man with whom she had come to Delhi from Karnataka January 6 after being promised to provide a job in New Delhi.
A police officer said that Zakir raped the woman many times.
"Zakir had also beaten her up. He along with his woman associate, Geeta, was contacting some clients in Mumbai and Pune to sell the victim. Meanwhile, the victim managed to give them a slip and reported the matter to police," said the officer.
The case was registered and both the accused were arrested on January 11 from Ghazipur area.
