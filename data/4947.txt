Rape
Description:
			A 28-year-old software professional with an IT major here was arrested by High Grounds police after being booked for allegedly raping and cheating a 24-year-old woman he met through a matrimonial website.

Cops tried to counsel the young people to arrive at a compromise but they started quarrelling outside the police station after the counselling session.

Sameen Raj Nadaf, son of a retired police inspector Mohiuddin Jamal and a native of Haveri, got acquainted with the woman, a resident of Vasanthnagar, through a website in April this year and they started seeing each other. Both their families agreed to the marriage but recently Sameen refused to marry her and started avoiding her.

The enraged woman approached the High Grounds police. Both were summoned to the police station in the presence of their families. A compromise was struck, but once outside the police station, Sameen Raj changed his mind and the woman went back to the cops. Police registered a case against under sections 420 (cheating) and 376 (rape). He was arrested and both were subjected to a medical examination at Victoria Hospital, police said.
