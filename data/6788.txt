Murder, Rape
Description:
			A 20-year-old Dalit woman was allegedly gang-raped and murdered by miscreants belonging to an upper caste in Jalesar area of Etah district on Friday. 

The accused are believed to have hanged the body from a tree after the murder to make it appear like a suicide, according to police sources. 

Police have registered an FIR and launched a manhunt to nab the culprits. 

According to police, the incident took place in the wee hours of Friday in Sikandarpur Madhi village in Jalesar when the four men dragged the girl out of her house to a field and raped her, and then strangled her to death. To avoid being found out, the accused hanged her body from a tree in the same field and fled from the spot. 

The victim's family was not at home at the time. Her parents had taken the girl's brother to a nearby hospital in the evening because the victim's brother had damaged his hand in a wheat thrasher on Thursday night. 

The family could not find their daughter when they returned home in the morning. When they started searching for her, they were told that their daughter was found hanging from a tree in the nearby field. 

The victim's body was taken down and sent for postmortem after senior administrative and police officials reached the spot and assured her relatives of taking stern action against the culprits. 

Jalesar circle officer Kalyan Singh said, "An FIR has been registered against four people. Two of them have been identified as brothers Ankit and Amit. Kailash and Praveen are the two others. All are in the age group of 22 to 25. All of them are currently absconding." 

A case has been registered under Sections 365 (kidnapping or abducting with intent secretly and wrongfully to confine person), 302 (murder), 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) and 376 (rape) of the IPC, Singh said.
