The decision of the court needs to be applauded. It brings the country one step closer to taking responsibility for victims of violence against women and it is a step in the right direction. 

The primary focus should be on providing justice but at the same time Centers for development of Women and Children should make use of their resources in providing assistance in terms of rehabilitation to victims such as the one mentioned in this report.
