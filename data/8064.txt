Molestation, Murder
Description:
			A woman was shot in the head and stomach allegedly by a village goon when she tried to resist a rape attempt in neighbouring Fatehpur district on Sunday evening. 

Family members accused the village hoodlum Indraraj Pal behind the brutal killing. "Indraraj Pal forcibly dragged the woman, who was giving water to the cattles, and molested her in the presence of family members and other villagers. When the woman resisted, the goon pulled out a country-made pistol and shot her in the head and stomach from point blank range. The goon after threatening others of dire consequences fled immediately while the woman, who suffered serious gunshot wounds succumbed at the spot," said station house officer Rajendra Singh. 

The incident occurred at Bijauli village under the limits of Bakewar police station of the district. The goon has been active in the area for the past few years, with several cases of heinous crime registered against him with separate police stations of the district. "It is a horrible incident and the guilty should be brought to book," demanded angry villagers, who staged a massive demonstration and refused to handover the body of the victim to the police for autopsy. Senior police officials, meanwhile, rushed to the spot and pacified the agitators assuring them of prompt action into the case. 

The police said, the woman, who was married about an year ago to a man in Gwaltoli area of Kanpur had come to meet her parents on the occasion of Karwachauth festival three days ago. 

"An FIR has been registered against Indraraj Pal and further investigations are underway in this regard," said SHO further. 

However, a hunt launched by police has not yielded any result so far.
