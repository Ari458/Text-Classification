Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			11-year-old Pooja (name changed) was allegedly raped twice by her father's assistant Sagar Shende at her residence, in Kotwali area. Shende sexually abused the girl when she was alone at home and subsequently when her father was fast asleep.

The shocking incident came to light when Pooja divulged the matter to her parents who approached Kotwali police. The cops immediately took Shende into custody before charging him with rape and threatening. He has also been slapped with relevant sections under Protection of children from sexual offences Act 2012.

Police said Shende, who worked with Pooja's father, also lived in the neighbourhood. He grabbed the opportunity of savaging the girl when she was alone as her parents had gone to hospital to meet a relative. He had also threatened Pooja of dire consequences if she divulged the matter before anyone. The scared girl did not reveal the ordeal to her parents. A desperate Shende, who had stayed back at Pooja's residence on Friday night, again forced himself upon the girl for the second time by gagging her.

A shell-shocked Pooja revealed about Shende's deeds in the morning prompting her parents to inform the police. The cops stated that Shende was a regular visitor at Pooja's place. Shende was quite familiar with the family.
