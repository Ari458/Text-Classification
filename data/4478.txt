Rape
Description:
			A 33-year-old woman who lives in south Mumbai filed a case of rape after her husband, who is a businessman, threatened to circulate among relatives a video that showed her in a "compromising position" with his friend, unless she gave him a divorce. 

The V P Road police registered the case against her husband, his associate (the friend) and an unknown person. They transferred the case to the Juhu police station as the alleged rape took place in their jurisdiction. 

The woman alleged that her husband's associate lured her into a relationship at the behest of her husband and raped her in a Juhu hotel after promising to marry her. She told the police that an unknown person, who was hiding in the room, recorded a video of the incident. The police say they are examining the details of the case and will accordingly initiate action. 

The woman and her husband were not on good terms and were living separately for a few years. They have a child, who lives with the woman. 

Last year, the husband's associate approached the woman, saying he belonged to the same community and was about to divorce his wife. He told the woman that he was interested in marrying her. Thereafter the two developed a close relationship. 

Last November, they visited a Juhu hotel, where he had sex with her after promising to marry her. After a few days, during a hearing of his divorce case, the husband produced in court photographs showing his wife with his associate. The husband argued that he should be given divorce as his wife had an extra-marital affair. 

The woman told the court that her husband was trying to defame her with the help of his friend. Afterwards, her husband threatened her with the video recording. The woman approached the police and filed her case.
