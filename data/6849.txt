Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			An automobile company employee who was accused of raping his colleague's 10-year-old daughter in a guesthouse has been arrested in Chennai.

The girl's father was questioned by a five-member team of Gurgaon Police. Sources said the child did not accuse her father of any misconduct or being party to the crime, although her mother had lodged a complaint against him, which was the basis of the FIR.

"Now that the accused has been arrested, he can reveal details of whether the father was involved in the crime. If he is found guilty, he too will be arrested," said ACP (crime) Rajesh Kumar.

The girl was raped by her father's colleague and roommate in Chennai, after the former took her there without informing her mother. Upon her return, she showed her mother her blood-stained clothes and revealed that one Neeraj Bhaiya had forced himself upon her one day while her father was out on work. The girl said she had kept her father in the dark about the rape, as the accused had threatened her with dire consequences if she told anyone.

The girl's mother filed a police complaint on Monday night, upon which police lodged.

An FIR was registered against the rapist and the girl's father, under sections 120B (criminal conspiracy), 506 (criminal intimidation), 363 (kidnapping) and Section 6 of POCSO (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) Act.
