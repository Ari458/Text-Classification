Description:
			A fast-track court of Bokaro on Friday sentenced a 32-year-old shopkeeper to 10 years' rigorous imprisonment for trying to kill a woman when she resisted his molestation bid last year.

Santosh Thakur, a resident of Balidih, around 14km from Bokaro steel city, was found guilty under Sections 307 (attempt to murder) and 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) of the IPC by the fast-track court of Bokaro special sessions judge Babita Prasad.

He was handed rigorous imprisonment for 10 years and three years, respectively.

Both the prison sentences will run concurrently.

Thakur, who appeared remorseless and was even spotted laughing while coming out of the court, was sent to Chas jail.

According to government lawyer R.K. Rai, the incident took place on February 15, 2015.

"The woman, a domestic help aged around 23 and also hailing from Balidih, was returning home around 6.30 in the evening when Thakur, who ran a grocery shop in the locality, stopped her near Haisabatu School. The area was isolated. He took full advantage of that and started harassing her," Rai said.

Thakur held her hand and began dragging her to a bush nearby. The lady raised an alarm and even retaliated, trying to free herself from his clutches. But Thakur attacked her.

"He was carrying a dagger. He fished it out and stabbed the woman several times on her abdomen. Despite getting badly injured, the victim kept on crying for help. A few persons, who were near the school, heard her cries and rushed to her rescue. Seeing them, Santosh fled," the government lawyer said.

Later, the woman was taken to Jaina More Hospital .

After a few days, Santosh was arrested by Balidih police.
