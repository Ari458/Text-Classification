Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			An eight-year-old girl was allegedly raped by her 37-year-old neighbour at Salap in Howrah's Domjur on Thursday evening. The alleged rapist, who is at large, is a widower with three children.

"On Thursday evening, when there was nobody around, the accused Manna allegedly told the girl that he would give her chocolates if she accompanied him back home. The child readily did so. There was nobody at Manna's home at that time and the accused took advantage of the situation. The child returned home and broke down before her parents who lodged a complaint with the Domjur police station immediately," an officer said.
