Murder
Description:
			The body of a 21-year-old woman was found with her throat slit at Noonmati here today in what is being suspected to be a case of sexual assault and murder.

Her partially clothed body fuelled suspicion of rape before murder.

Police, however, said they would wait for the autopsy report to confirm rape.

A police source said the victim, a college student , had left her house in the Noonmati police station area around noon for library, after which she is suspected to have been abducted and murdered.

Her body was recovered in a shrubbery around 2pm. The police have detained two youths in connection with the murder.

The source said the duo were friends of the victim and first to spot her body.

"We are questioning them to find out if they have any role in the crime. Since they are being questioned on the basis of suspicion and their involvement is not yet established, they have not been arrested," the source said.

A case has been registered under Section 302 IPC at Noonmati police station and the post-mortem was conducted at Gauhati Medical College and Hospital.

The murder has sparked tension in the area with family members and neighbours of the victim staging protests with her body demanding arrest of the culprits.

Deputy commissioner of police (central) Amitava Sinha visited the scene of crime and took stock of the investigation.

"Whether she was sexually assaulted before murder can only be confirmed after we receive the post-mortem report. An investigation is on to ascertain the motive," Sinha said.
