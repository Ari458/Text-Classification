Crime, Rape
Description:
			A local court has sentenced a man to gallows for raping a girl and later killing her along with her grandmother in Haridwar district.

26-year-old Wajid Ali had raped the girl on February 19 and later poisoned her leading to her death.

When the girl's grandmother raised alarm, Wajid crushed her under the wheels of his vehicle.

District Judge Dhananjay Chaturvedi awarded death to Wajid observing that the case belonged to the "rarest of rare category", and the culprit deserved to be awarded a punishment no less than the death penalty.

The way in which the convict crushed the victim's 65-year-old grandmother under the wheels of his car was most inhuman.

The court had reserved its order after convicting Ali on October 29.
