Child Sexual Abuse, Molestation
Description:
			Mahesh Pandurang Patil, 28, an ayurvedic lecturer from Maharashtra, was arrested by Ponda police on Thursday evening for molesting a 14-year-old school girl in Ponda on Wednesday afternoon. The girl's family filed the police complaint on Thursday afternoon. 

Quoting the complaint, police said Patil, who lives in Khandepar-Ponda, had come to Ponda town on Wednesday afternoon to recharge his cellphone's talk-time at a shop at Kaziwada. After recharging he went up to the fourth floor of the building. 

"On the fourth floor he met the girl and asked her about a multi-state cooperative bank. The girl told him the way to the bank and as she turned to enter her flat, the accused allegedly molested her," said police. 

Patil was identified from footage captured on the CCTV installed at the cellphone shop, police said. The offence has been registered under IPC Section 354 A (physical contact and advances involving unwelcome and explicit sexual overtures) and Section 8 of the Goa Children's Act. 

Patil has been arrested and will be produced before the children's court on Friday, said police. PSI Gokuldas Malik is investigating the case.
