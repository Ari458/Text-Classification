Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A man was on Saturday arrested for allegedly raping a 10-year-old schoolgirl repeatedly at Manorama Nagar in Thane city, police said. 

The accused, identified as Shivmani Ramdular Jaiswal (29), a house painter by profession, was arrested early this morning following a complaint lodged by the victim last night. 

The accused had repeatedly sexually assaulted the girl between May and July 15, PSI A D Gangawane of the Kapurbawdi police station said. 

According to police, Shivmani knew the family members of the victim and used to visit their place frequently. He knew that the girl's father was away in Delhi and her mother goes to work in the day. When the girl, along with her two siblings, would return home from the school in the evening, he would go there and offer money to the girl's siblings asking them to buy chocolates. 

When her siblings would go away, he used to sexually assault the minor. He would threaten her with dire consequences if she resisted and revealed it to anybody, the police officer said. 

A few days back the girl complained of stomach pain and was taken to hospital. During medical examination, doctors found that she had been subjected to sexual assault. When they took her into confidence, she told about her ordeal to them.

Later, the girl also told about the incident to her mother, following which a complaint was lodged with the help of local NGOs. 

The accused has been charged under sections 376 (rape) of the IPC and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. 

Further investigation into the case is on.
