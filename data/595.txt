Rape
Description:
			A 40 year old housewife was today gang raped at knife point in front of her husband and children by three dacoits at Pharandewadi village near Phaltan town in the district, police said.

The accused were apparently unhappy with the loot they managed to lay their hands on during the dacoity. They then grabbed the 40-year-old victim and took turns to rape her in front of her husband and two children, they said.
