Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A man was on Tuesday arrested for allegedly raping his 22-year-old daughter for the past 16 years and impregnating her twice. The 48-year-old father was arrested along with the victim's mother from Parli city, 90 kms from Beed, police said. The girl had lodged a complaint in this regard on Monday night in Beed city and the case was then transferred to Parli tehsil police station.

"The victim, who lived with her family in Parli, was being repeatedly raped by her father for the last 16 years. The girl even became pregnant and gave birth to a girl child. However, even after that the accused continued to rape her," Assistant Sub-Inspector B M Sheikh of Beed city police station said.

The girl met Superintendent of Police (SP) Anil Paraskar yesterday and narrated everything to him, following which the senior police official asked the police to register a case against her parents.

"In the complaint, the girl said that three months ago she became pregnant for the second time. However, her father started pressurising her to abort the child. The victim's mother was also aware of the girl's ordeal, but did not help her," Sheikh said.

Parli police arrested the couple, who were produced in a local court this afternoon. The court remanded them in a five-day police custody.

Further investigation into the case is on, police said.
