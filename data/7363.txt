Child Sexual Abuse, Molestation
Description:
			An employee of a multinational company has been arrested by the Kadugodi police on charge of sexually assaulting his five-and-a-half-year-old daughter.

The wife of the suspect, in a complaint, alleged that her husband's behaviour with their young daughter had been inappropriate and she had found him touching the girl at inappropriate places many times.

Though she had warned him about his behaviour several times, he had continued with his misdemeanour, she alleged.

The police arrested him after the woman walked with her daughter to the police station to complain about him on Friday night.

She approached the police following a heated argument with her husband after she caught him red-handed.

The couple is from Kerala and had moved to the city three years ago. They reside in a villa in a gated community. Based on the complaint, the police arrested the man and booked him under Section 376 IPC and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act.

We have asked for medical examination of the child and are also probing other angles in this case, a senior police officer said.
