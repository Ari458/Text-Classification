She was staying with her parents in Thoohoor after she delivered a male child a year back. Investigation revealed that Diana had gone to the river bank on Thursday evening to attend nature's call. However, when she failed to return home till late in the night, Diana's parents started searching for her. But they couldn't find her anywhere in the surroundings. On Friday morning, to their shock and dismay they found her body washed ashore near the bathing gates.

Police had suspected it to be a case of murder, when they found some injuries on her body.
