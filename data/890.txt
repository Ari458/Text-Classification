Description:
			The ashram management said suspect Khurshid Khan molested the minor promising to pay her Rs 5. Members of the Child Welfare Committee (CWC) say despite repeated requests the police did not send the girl for a medical test. The ashram has blamed the girl's character. The accused is watchman of a construction site on an empty plot near the ashram.

"the girl is at fault as she would go to the watchman whenever he called her to his cabin" ~ Ashram Management
