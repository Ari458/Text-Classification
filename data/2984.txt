Rape
Description:
			The man suspected of raping an 11-year-old girl and then strangling her to death with a school tie in a village just 100 km from Pune, has been arrested.

The victim, a Class 5 student, was usually picked up by her father from her school in Galandewadi village in Daund Taluka near Pune. On Thursday, he couldn't. So, she started walking back home alone.

The 22-year-old accused, finding the girl walking home alone, dragged her to a nearby sugarcane field where he raped her before choking her to death, the police said.

The class 5 student had turned 11 last week on August 15.

''We searched for her and found her body in the field. She was raped... the police told us he strangled her with the school tie... I want that he be sent to the gallows for this crime," said the victim's father.

The accused was arrested from a neighbouring village after a huge manhunt was launched for him. The police says he had been seen in the village every day since the incident. More information about the suspect will be revealed at a press conference this evening, the police added.

Her family and the entire village is at a loss of words. No major crime had ever been committed in their village till this incident.

"Criminals don't fear law... they will come after serving five to seven years in jail and who knows they may not do it again?" asked  a village elder.
