Description:
			On December 12, when Inspector Karbhari was patrolling an isolated area of Thakur village at Kandivli (E). It was then that he noticed a man dragging the minor girl by her hair near Mahindra gate. Kharbhari rushed to the spot and found out that (Accused)Singh was trying to allegedly kidnap the school girl. Upon my asking as to why she was crying, she narrated the entire incident, added Karbhari, who immediately informed the Samata Nagar police of the incident and handed over Singh to them.
