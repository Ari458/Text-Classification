Abduction, Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A partially blind minor girl was raped and assaulted by two persons at Harishpur village under Nuagaon police limits on Saturday. After the village heads failed to punish the accused, the girl's father lodged an FIR at Nuagaon police station on Sunday night.

The girl, belonging to Dalit community, was returning from agriculture field on Saturday evening when Mithun Bhoi and Ganesh Bhoi of the same village abducted her and took her to an isolated place. They gagged the girl and then assaulted her as a result of which, she fell unconscious. The accused then raped her and fled.

As the girl did not return home for a long time, her parents started searching for her only to find her lying unconscious in the field. After regaining consciousness, the girl informed her parents about the incident.

When the parents took up the matter with the village heads, the latter desisted from registering a police case as it would bring bad name to the village. Later, they conducted a meeting where they imposed a fine of Rs 50,000 on each accused. This, however, did not go down well with the families of the accused who threatened the girl's father of dire consequences.

Then, the girl's father filed a police case against the two accused, who are now absconding.
