Rape
Description:
			A married woman was allegedly gangraped by three youths in a hotel in Karnal district of Haryana, days after a 21-year college student in the state was raped for the second time by same offenders who had sexually assaulted her three years ago.

The woman, hailing from Sonepat, was raped yesterday in Karnal, they said, adding, she was in contact with one of the accused over phone for the past few days.

"The accused called the woman to Karnal yesterday and once she arrived, he took her to a hotel where he was joined by two of his accomplices in the crime," DSP Karnal, Jitender Gahlawat said.

He said all the three accused, two of whom hailed from Asandh and one from Karnal, have been arrested today. They have been charged with rape and other relevant sections of IPC.

The accused fled the spot after hiring an autorickshaw for the victim, the DSP said, adding, she was taken to a hospital by the driver after her condition worsened.

A case was registered against the accused after recording the victim's statement.

The incident comes close on the heels of a gangrape incident involving a 21-year-old college student in Rohtak.

The victim was allegedly raped by five persons in Rohtak district on July 13. This was a repeat offence with two of the offenders also named as accused in a case of gangrape of the girl in Bhiwani three years ago.

Yesterday, Haryana police had constituted an SIT to probe into the matter. The NHRC also issued a notice to the Haryana Government seeking report in the incident.
