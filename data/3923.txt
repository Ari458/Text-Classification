Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			A man, facing trial for raping a 12-year-old girl in 2011, has been sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for seven years by a Delhi court which said the testimony of the victim was reliable.

Additional Sessions Judge Gulshan Kumar held 30-year-old Vijay guilty of the offence punishable under section 376 (rape) of the IPC and also imposed a fine of Rs 10,000 on him.

According to the police, Vijay took the minor, who was his neighbour, to a secluded place on October 28, 2011 and raped her.

The victim was residing with her maternal aunt and she told her relative about the incident after which police were called.

In her deposition, the girl told the court that on October 28, 2011, she had gone to a nearby market in Mehrauli and Vijay followed her and took her to a secluded place and raped her.

During the trial, Vijay denied the allegations levelled against him and claimed that he was falsely implicated in the case at the instance of the family members of the girl.

The court, however, convicted him while relying on the testimony of the victim and the medical evidence.
