Rape
Description:
			A 35-year-old mentally disabled woman was allegedly gang-raped by three youngsters near Jalaripeta area in the city, police said on Wednesday. 

The police have arrested two of the accused for allegedly raping a mentally-ill beggar for the past few days. The third accused is yet to be nabbed, police said.

Police said the victim had been staying on the footpath near the naval canteen for the past few weeks and the accused had been raping her during the night hours.

One Town police station inspector Syed Mohammad Illiyas said a case under Section 376 (D) of the Indian Penal Code had been registered and an investigation is on. 

He said the victim had been medically examined and reports were awaited.
