Rape
Description:
			A 32-year-old Navi Mumbai resident who was found guilty of allegedly raping a 22-year-old girl in October 2011 was sentenced to seven years's rigorous imprisonment by Thane Sessions Court Judge V V Virkar.

Additional public prosecutor Ashok Khamkar told the court that it was on the first day of October 2011 that the accused came to the rape survivor's house and committed the crime.

When the girl raised an alarm the accused locked the house from inside and allegedly continued with his act.

Hearing the girl's alarm neighbours nabbed the accused and handed him over to the Turbhe police.

The court relied on the victim's narration and evidence given by other witnesses, before it sentenced the accused and fined him Rs 2500.

In her judgement, the judge noted that since the accused trespassed into her house when she was alone and sexually abused her, no leniency could be shown to him.
