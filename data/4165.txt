Murder, Dowry Harassment
Description:
			A 35-year-old man has been sentenced to life imprisonment by a local court for torturing and killing his pregnant wife for dowry.

Additional district and sessions court judge Suchitra S Ghodke sentenced Kesharsingh Harjindsingh Chaddha to life imprisonment and also imposed Rs 500 fine on him for mentally and physically harassing his wife Gurupreet for dowry and then killing her and throwing the body from top floor of their building in 2012.

Chaddha had married Gurupreet, hailing from Ghoti in Nashik district, in June 2003 and within a few days of the marriage he started harassing her mentally and physically for dowry.

The wife later lodged complaints against her husband at Igatpuri and Nashik Road police stations, but he continued to harass her.

According to senior government pleader Ajay Misar, on May 26, 2012, when Gurupreet was 5-month pregnant, Chaddha beat her up severely and used a sharp weapon to kill her. He then threw the body from top of the building -- Adharshila Co-op Housing Society at Devlali camp near here -- where they were staying.

Nashik police registered an offence of murder against Chaddha the same day and filed a case in the sessions court, which examined 16 witnesses and awarded him life imprisonment yesterday.

Misar said the accused started harassing his wife soon after marriage and continued it for nine years. The murder was pre-planned as he often used to beat her with his waist belt.

There were 18 small and big wounds found on the body by doctors during the post mortem.

Gurupreet's father Jitsingh Pandhe, a resident of Ghoti who was present in the court during sentencing, told reporters that he wanted death penalty for the accused as he harassed his daughter for nine years.

He said on May 26, 2012, he received a call from his daughter seeking help, but by the time he reached, his daughter was dead.
