Description:
			A 14-year-old boy allegedly threatened to rape a 13-year-old girl when she rejected his proposal for an affair. The accused teenager and his 19-year-old brother were booked by police on Sunday for threatening the girl after the victim's father lodged a complaint against them at Pandesara police station. 

Manish Soni, a dance teacher, and his younger brother were allegedly harassing and threatening the girl. Manish was arrested by police on Sunday. His younger brother was detained and later released after questioning. 

The 14-year-old accused knew the girl and had been following her. He stopped the girl on Saturday and proposed to her when she was going to her tuition class. The girl did not reply to him which angered the accused, who threatened to rape her if she complained about him at home. 

The girl informed her family about the threat on returning home. The girl's family members went to meet the accused and his family but were allegedly threatened of dire consequences by Manish. 

"The victim girl and the accused are minors. The elder brother of the accused boy has been arrested while the latter released after his statement was registered," said M V Patel, police inspector, Pandesara police station. 

Police sources said the girl's family did not wish to lodge a complaint and wanted to sort out the issue through discussion with the accused's family. They approached police after they were threatened by the family of the accused. 

"More details will be available once police register the statements of the witnesses in the case," police said.
