Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			Police have picked up a labourer for interrogation for allegedly sexually harassing his daughter. Police said Ganesan (33), a labourer from a village near Alangulam, sexually harassed his eldest daughter, a school student, on several occasions and the girl, unable to bear the torture, started living with her relative.

When the girl’s mother came to know about this problem, she filed a complaint with Superintendent of Police V. Vikraman, who ordered the Ooththumalai police to conduct a thorough enquiry. As the charges were found to be true, police have picked up Ganesan for interrogation.
