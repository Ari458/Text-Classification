Description:
			The BTech student who was charged with harassing an MSc student at Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University Campus on Monday evening has been suspended with a show cause notice till the sexual harassment committee decides punishment for him.

The accused, Vineet, reportedly entered the campus and started passing comments on the girl. The guard reportedly intervened and called the proctor. Vineet, a BTech II year student of BBAU, was reportedly drunk according to medical reports. "We could hardly take him to the health centre. Because he was under the influence of alcohol, he was misbehaving with the staff present there as well," said proctor Victor Babu.

The accused and the victim have been sent notices to be present before the sexual harassment committee next week so that the punishment can be decided.

A meeting of proctorial board was called after the victim's complaint to the warden on Tuesday. "We will not tolerate such behaviour on campus," said Sudarshan Verma, dean, student welfare.
