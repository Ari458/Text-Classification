Murder
Description:
			A young woman was found brutally murdered with her body stuffed in a suitcase that was found at a railway gate near Dindoli overbridge in Surat today, police said.

"The body was half-naked. The woman seems to be in the age group of 20-22. The body was found in an abandoned suitcase at Maninagar Society area here," said Dindoli police inspector S J Baloch.

The incident came to light when some locals informed the police after sighting the suitcase.

The identity of the deceased could not be known as her face has multiple stab wounds, apparently inflicted with a sharp-edged weapon, Baloch said, adding that police have roped in forensic experts and employed a dog squad to look for clues.

"We are taking help from other police stations to get information of the missing persons. We have also approached computer experts to reconstruct the profile of her face," the officer said, adding that the deceased had a blue welt on her neck which indicates that she could have been strangulated.

"The body did not develop rigor-mortis (stiffness) and on that basis we can say that she might have been killed around 12 hours back," Baloch said.

He said that the body has been sent for postmortem and the report is awaited.
