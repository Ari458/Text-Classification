Molestation
Description:
			A woman escaped an alleged rape attempt by a brick-kiln owner in Kanpur Dehat. Reports stated that accused Ramesh Chandra Sachan of Gayatrinagar under the Bhognipur police station tried to rape his employee's wife when her husband had gone to a nearby market. Initially the cops tried to hush up the incident but lodged a case after victim's family members informed the senior officials. A police official at Bhognipur police station, however, said, "According to the woman, when she was alone at home located close to the brick-kiln compound, Sachan visited her and tried to rape her."
