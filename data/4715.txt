The incident took place yesterday when the parents of the child had gone to Chilhari to attend a wedding function, Kanker Superintendent of Police R N Dash told PTI.

One of the accused Gopi Chured (23) took the girl from her parents on the pretext of taking her for an outing in the village, following which he took the toddler to a secluded place near the wedding venue, where he assaulted the child along with his friend Vasudev Kosma (34), the SP said.
