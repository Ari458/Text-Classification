Rape
Description:
			The 19 year old newly-wed girl was married only a week ago. Her husband apparently called her to Rajchandrapur station in Bally, from where she was picked up by the two rapists. 

"It seems she took a train from Tarakeswar to Bally and changed trains to reach Rajchandrapur. She looked around for her husband but did not find him. When she walked out of the station, two men approached her. It is not clear whether they told her that her husband had sent them or she said she was waiting for him. The two took her to a nearby house and abused her sexually," a police officer said.

The duo apparently drugged her with some food and drinks as she waited in the house for her husband. When she fell unconscious, they raped her till the wee hours of Thursday. She partly came to her senses around 2am and realized what had happened.
