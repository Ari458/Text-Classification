Abuse
Description:
			A 40-year-old auto driver has been arrested for allegedly misbehaving with a woman reporter near Kurla after an argument erupted over his refusing a fare on Tuesday. The auto driver then made a suggestive remark when the reporter pulled him out with the help of her woman associates before he ran away. The V.B. Nagar police traced and arrested him on Sunday.
According to the complaint filed by the 24-year-old woman, a journalist with a local Hindi daily, the incident took place Tuesday evening near the Phoenix Mall on the LBS Road in Kurla (west) when she and two of her friends were trying to flag an auto towards Kurla station. We stepped out of the mall around 4.30 pm and hailed an auto, asking him to take us to Kurla station. He refused the fare saying he was going in the opposite direction. When we asked him where exactly he was going, he asked me if I too would like to accompany him to his home. At this, I snapped and got into an argument with him ad he began to abuse us verbally. He also said he had seen many like me and we could not do anything to him. I then grabbed his collar and dragged him out of the auto. But he managed to speed away, said the reporter while speaking to The Asian Age.
The woman soon informed a functionary of a woman journalists union, which in turn intimated the zonal DCP and local police station. A delegation soon met CP Rakesh Maria who ordered an FIR to be registered. The police has filed a case and began tracing the auto driver.
Inquiries soon revealed that the accused often came to a particular CNG gas station at Kamani near Vidya Vihar to refuel before ending his shift. On Sunday afternoon, we waited at the spot with the reporter with us. Around 4 pm, the woman identified the mancoming in an auto towards the pump and we intercepted him, said an officer.
The accused has been identified as Rameshkumar Jaiswal (40), a resident of Ghatkopar (east).
