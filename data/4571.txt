Abduction, Crime, Rape
Description:
			A woman in India sought to enact revenge on her daughter's rapist, so she got four men, including her own husband, to gang rape the wife of the accused man.

According to reports, the revenge rape, which happened in Barabanki, Uttar Pradesh, India on Sunday, left the accused rapist's wife struggling for life on the side of a road.

The mother of the teenage girl that was originally raped allegedly called on three men and her husband to rape the wife of her daughter's rapist in retaliation for the crime. The four men wound up abducting the woman, taking her to an area near a police station in a neighboring village, and gang raped her.

Later on, the men drove the raped woman to an area along the side of a road where they dumped her and fled the scene. The woman was discovered by villagers and brought to the hospital where she is now reportedly in critical condition.

Reports claim that authorities have yet to file a police report.

A 2013 report by More Magazine discusses India's high rape statistics, calling it the rape capital of the world, while comparing the alarming numbers to those of the United States. The shocking comparison shows that while there seem to be more rapes reported in India, the same number or more happen in America. The report says that every 20 minutes, a woman is raped in India, and most are under the age of 18.
