Rape
Description:
			A 19-year-old girl was allegedly gang-raped by a group of seven men at Amoni in Nagaon district on Monday night. The victim was later rescued by locals from a bush near NH-37 on Tuesday morning. She is from the Haiborgaon area in the district, some 54 km from here.

Police said the girl was with a boy named Raju, who along with his six friends and a driver, allegedly gang-raped the girl and then dumped her. The accused are still at large.

Sources said she was in touch with the accused on WhatsApp for the last one year. On Monday, it was her birthday and she met him for the first time.

"The boy took her to Tezpur for shopping. While returning, they stopped near Amoni and got drunk. Then, the boy called some of his friends who raped her. Locals found her in the morning," Nagaon police said.

The accused have also taken away her gold ring and other jewellery.

However, locals blamed police's role. "She was raped near the highway and the area is quite busy round the clock. But the criminals committed the crime and then fled. It means there was no police patrolling when the crime happened," said a local.

On Monday, another woman was reportedly raped in the Rupohihat area of the district. From January to April, the state has registered at least 557 rape cases.
