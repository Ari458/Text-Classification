Abduction, Rape
Description:
			Police on Monday arrested a 30-year-old driver for posing as a policeman to abduct and rape a woman in Tirukazhukundram on Sunday night.

Police charged S Palani, of Nerumbur, under IPC Sections 366 (abduction) and 376 (rape). A magistrate's court sent Palani to prison.

Police said Palani raped the 30-year-old wife of a mason, Siva, from Tirupattur in Vellore district, who worked at a construction site in Chennai and lived in a makeshift shack there.

"Siva's wife and their two children live in Tirupattur," a police officer said. "The wife set out to visit her husband on Sunday and arrived at the Chengalpet bus terminus late in the night."

She called her husband and informed him about the visit only after arriving in the city.
"Siva would take an hour to get to Chengalpet so he asked a friend to pick up his wife," the officer said. "Palani, who was at the bus terminus, saw the woman get into the friend's car and followed them."

Palani told police he thought the woman was a sex worker. He went to the site on a motorcycle and the woman opened the door when he knocked. He saw Siva inside the shack and inferred that he was her husband.

"Claiming to be a policeman, he asked the woman to come to the Tirukazhukundram police station for questioning , coercing her by claiming that policemen spotted her alone at the bus terminus and suspected she was up to no good," the officer said. "He ignored Siva's plea to let him bring her to the police station on Monday."

Palani threatened the woman, made her sit on the motorcycle and took her to a secluded place where he raped her.

Police arrested Palani in the early hours of Monday.
