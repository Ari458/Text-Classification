Description:
			A nine-year-old girl was allegedly raped and left critically injured after being lifted from house while her parents were asleep, police said.

The incident took place at Loco Colony in Jatni, about 20 km from the state capital, last night. The girl was bleeding profusely when she was recovered from an abandoned house in the colony this morning. The victim has been admitted to hospital here in a critical condition.

She has been put in the ICU and undergoing treatment for multiple injuries on her body, doctors said. "The girl is out of danger. There are several injuries on her body. She is put on observation," Capital Hospital director Biswabhusan Patnaik said.

"We do not know when the girl was lifted. They had closed the door from outside. We find the girl this morning and she has named who has done it," said the victim's father, who works as a daily labourer. Jatni police today arrested the accused identified as Ahiraj Naik, who was recently released from jail on bail. He has several criminal cases against him, police said.
