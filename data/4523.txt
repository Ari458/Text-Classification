Dowry Harassment
Description:
			A man demanded additional dowry of Rs.5 lakh from the parents of a bride claiming the girl was obese, in an incident that led to protests outside the Machavaram police station.

P Vikram Naidu from Hyderabad had agreed to marry a girl from Machavaram, whose parents had even agreed to pay a dowry of Rs.10 lakh. However, a couple of days before the wedding, Naidu reportedly told the girl he would marry her only if her parents gave him another Rs.5 lakh as she was "heavy". The groom even suggested that she should shed 20 kg if she does not want to pay up.

Stung to the core, the girl's parents sought help from Machavaram police and local CPI leaders. When the city CPI secretary Donepudi Shankar approached the police, sub-inspector Ramesh allegedly misbehaved with him and tried to push him out of the station, leading to a massive protest by CPI activists in the city.

With the protest showing no sign of abating, the city police commissioner intervened. The activists, however, demanded the suspension of the sub-inspector.
