Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			Villagers of Madhuban in Kathikund of Dumka district blocked the Dumka-Pakur Road for 90 minutes demanding the arrest of the culprits involved in the gang-rape of a 13-year-old tribal girl. The girl succumbed to her injuries. Her body was brought to the village, triggering anger among the villagers.

DSP Anil Kumar Srivastava, however, managed to convince villagers to lift the road blockade and perform her last rites by assuring them to arrest the culprits soon. The postmortem of the deceased girl was done in Bengal hospital and the report was awaited.
