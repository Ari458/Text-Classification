Description:
			The husband and in-laws of a 28-year-old housewife here have been booked for allegedly throwing her out of the house as she was unable to conceive after marriage, police said today.

The woman, in her complaint, alleged that her husband Dinkar Khade, father-in-law Angad Khade and mother-in-law Meena Khade, all residents of Ambivili in Thane's Kalyan township, had been mentally and physically harassing her since 2004 as she was not able to conceive, Mahatma Phule police station inspector D M Katke said.

They had threatened her on several earlier occassions that they would drive her out of the house if she did not conceive. Later, they also demanded Rs 50,000 from her parents which they could not fulfil, Katke said quoting the complaint.

Yesterday, after the three accused threw her out of the house, the woman lodged a complaint against them.

No arrest has been made so far in this connection, police added.
