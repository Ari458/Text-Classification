Child Sexual Abuse, Rape
Description:
			The Kalamassery police on Saturday arrested Rafeeque Kudilil (40), a resident of Kalamassery, for raping his friend's minor daughter. 

Police said the accused had molested the Plus One student for nearly six months. The incident came to light when the girl recited her ordeal to her friend's mother, who in turn informed the police. The girl was abused when her parents, both daily wage labourers, were away at work. The girl did not say anything about the incident to her parents as Rafeeque had threatened her with dire consequences. The girl and her parents were staying in a rented home. Rafeeque continued to abuse her even after they shifted to another house in Kalamassery. 

Rafeeque was booked under Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) (rape) and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act 2012. The accused will be produced before the judicial first class magistrate court on Sunday.
