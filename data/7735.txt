Description:
			A woman from Kalwa lost her finger following an acid attack by a robber who allegedly wanted to rob her gold ring weighing five grams.

Hemangi Malegaonkar (54) has told the police that the attacker was her co-passenger in a Thane Municipal Transport bus when he emptied a small bottle on her finger, which disfigured her finger. The ring finger on which she was wearing a gold ring fell off due to the impact and the robber immediately pounced on the ring to make a hasty exit from the
running bus.

Malegaonkar, a Chendani Koliwada resident, was travelling in the crowded bus on August 24 and the accused was standing on the aisle of the bus, waiting to get off. Malegaon felt something uneasy on her hand and found blood stains on her hand as her ring finger was completely ripped-off.

"As soon as the victim saw the finger, she alerted her family members and was rushed to a private hospital. Though the incident took place on Monday, the victim registered an offence with us on Thursday," said a police official.

The victim lost her ring worth Rs 10,000. The police were taken by surprise as to how she did not feel any pain when the finger was completely broken due to the acid.

The police refused to answer any of the questions related to the acid attack claiming that they were investigating the case from all angles and in a day or two, the case would
be detected.

An offence has been registered under Sections 326 and 329 of the Indian Penal Code.
