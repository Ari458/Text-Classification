Description:
			Four persons have been booked for allegedly molesting and threatening to kill a salon owner in Sector 31. Police said the main accused is the victim's business partner.

Though none of them has been arrested, cops said on Friday they have lodged an FIR, based on the woman's complaint and probing the case.

The incident happened on Thursday afternoon when an argument broke out just outside the salon between the woman and the main accused over business matters. Soon the argument turned ugly and the main accused and his three friends beat up the woman, molested her and even threatened to kill her.

However, wasting no time, the victim had immediately called up the police control room, but by the time cops reached the spot, the accused had fled.

"Two of the accused have been identified as Manoj and Jitender. As per the woman's complaint, we have lodged an FIR against all four under sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 354 (molestation) and 506 (threat to kill) of the Indian Penal Code and are looking into the case from all angles," said Chander Kanta, the investigating officer.
