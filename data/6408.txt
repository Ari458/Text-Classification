Dowry Harassment, Rape
Description:
			A youth was arrested here for allegedly raping his fiancée and later ditching her for failure of her parents to pay him dowry of Rs 2 crore, police said today.

The accused, identified as P. Parvesh, was engaged with the girl, a daughter of a APSP battalion police officer, and their marriage was fixed on December 12, 2014, said III Town police station inspector B Tirumala Rao.

He said Parvesh, an MBA graduate and son of a city-based businessman, allegedly entered into physical relations with the girl before their marriage.

He did not turn up for his wedding on December 12 after the girl's parents expressed their inability to pay him the dowry for the purpose of setting up a plant, Rao said.
