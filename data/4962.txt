Child Sexual Abuse, Molestation
Description:
			A 21-year-old man was arrested for allegedly trying to rape his younger, teenaged sister in west Delhi on Wednesday, the police said. The incident was reported from Mianwali Nagar.

The accused, who is apparently a drunkard, was thrashed in public by his mother after the incident came to light before being handed over to the police.

According to the police, the man was under the influence of alcohol when he tried to force himself on his 16-year-old sister. The family had retired to bed after dinner on Wednesday evening.

There was a power cut in the area because of which their mother decided to go to the terrace and sleep there, leaving her children alone in the bedroom as they were already asleep, said a senior police officer.

As soon as the accused saw his mother leave the room, he went over to his sleeping sister and, allegedly, tried to undress her.

The teenager, a student of Class XI at a local government school, however, immediately woke up with a start and realised what her brother was up to. She then began screaming for help. Hearing her screams, their mother ran downstairs to the room where the daughter narrated the incident to her, the officer said.

The woman then dragged her son to the street and beat him up in front of all the neighbours, before calling the police and handing him over to them, the officer added.

A female police officer recorded the teenager's statement on the basis of which a criminal case was filed at the Mianwali Nagar police station.

According to the police, the accused has been arrested under several sections of the Indian Penal Code related to molestation as well as under sections of the POCSO Act.
