Dowry Harassment, Rape
Description:
			A 28-year-old pregnant woman, daughter of a retired IAS officer, was allegedly raped by her brother-in-law at her husband's house in Mysuru. The victim approached Indiranagar police, who transferred the case to Mysuru police.

City Police Commissioner M N Reddi told reporters that based on the complaint, Indiranagar police registered a case under Sections 341 (wrongful restraint), 376 (rape), 307 (attempt to murder), 498(A) (dowry harassment) of IPC and other sections against her in-laws.

As the victim had sought security for her husband and her family members, we made appropriate arrangements, Reddi said.

The victim had alleged in her complaint that her husband's older brother raped her on November 11, 2014 when she was eight months pregnant. He allegedly barged into the room while she was asleep and raped her before trying to strangulate her. The victim's husband, who heard her screaming, had rescued her.

The complaint said the attacker threatened the couple that he would kill them if they revealed about the incident to anyone. Even her in-laws stopped them from filing a complaint. The victim, who shifted to Bengaluru along with her husband, then filed a case.

She also accused her father-in-law of harassing her for dowry.As the family business was not doing well, they harassed me to sell my father's property in Bengaluru and give `45 crore.
Speaking to Express, Mysuru City Police Commissioner M A Saleem said, We received the case file on Friday and I have instructed VV Puram police to investigate .
