Rape
Description:
			A third-year student of the Government Dental College here was detained by the police after his former batchmate, a native of Hyderabad, accused him of trying to outrage her modesty in the wee hours of Sunday. 

Reports say P Sridhar (25) went to the girl's flat in Srinivasa Nagar Bank Colony around 2 am. As soon as the 23-year-old opened the door, Sridhar tried to force himself upon her but she managed to escape. The victim drove him out of the flat, and lodged a complaint with the local police in the morning. 

According to Patamata circle inspector K Damodara Rao, the accused was under the influence of alcohol when he visited the flat. "In her complaint the victim also said that Sridhar has been harassing her for the past two years," the inspector told TOI. 

High drama ensued in Patamata police station on Sunday, thanks to the college management's attempts for an immediate settlement. Representatives of various student bodies who accompanied the victim alleged that the management had made several calls to the victim, asking her to withdraw the case. "They have been promising to take action against Sridhar," a PSDU activist said. 

Incidentally, the victim and the accused were in the same batch until last year. Sridhar, hailing from Kakinada in East Godavari district, was detained because of poor grades while she was promoted. 

Sridhar is being questioned about all this. A case has been registered under sections 354 (c) and 376 of IPC.
