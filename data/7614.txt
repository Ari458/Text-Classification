Rape
Description:
			A 55-year-old woman has alleged that she was raped by two men in Survey Park on Sunday night and that police initially refused to take her complaint, saying she was "too old to be a rape victim". 

According to the complaint, the woman was closing her tea stall on a service road when three men arrived and demanded to be served. She refused. Angered, two of them raped her while the third stood watch, she says, adding that Survey Park police turned her away. 

Police denied the claim and said the medical report timings prove there was no delay in filing a case. "We have received the complaint. The woman's statement is being recorded," said joint CP (crime) Pallab Kanti Ghosh. Police have called for CCTV footage from the area.
