Child Sexual Abuse, Rape, Sexual Harassment at Work
Description:
			J Prabudass (65) who was running a children’s home in Madambakkam was arrested by police on Thursday for allegedly raping a 14-year-old girl.
 
The crime came to light when the 14-year-old delivered a baby girl at a government hospital on August 31. Doctors at the hospital informed the police after they had suspicions.

The home he was running was sealed in July by the government after a social worker alerted the police that it was unauthorised. Nine children had been rescued from the home by the police and were handed over to their parents after the police traced them. 
 
The girl has reportedly revealed to the police that she was being sexually abused by Prabudass over the last one year. The 65-year-old was running the home with his son and daughter-in-law. All three have been arrested by the police under the Juvenile Justice Act.
