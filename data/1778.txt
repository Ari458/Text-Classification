Rape
Description:
			The leading University for women in India-The Banasthali University is authorised by shameless beings. Known for its reputation, the University is proud of the Indian culture prevelant in its campus. But the truth of their culture came into light when the Authority started suppressing the incident of two rapes in the campus on the same night-one in their cine complex and the other in the hospital of the campus, both by the staff of the uni. When other students of the campus started protesting, firstly the authority denied the occurrence of any such incident.Later, after long agitation ,when police and media came to the campus, the people in power tried to stop them from interrupting in the matter.
They talk of student's security when anyone comes to meet them in the campus. They only allow parents to meet the girls and require some letter signed by parents when some other relative is there to meet them. But where is this security when modesty of the girls are outraged by their own  staff??One of the girls was raped in ambulance by the driver.
The authority is trying to hide the matter.

The students who were protesting were stopped to do so by the hostel wardens and the teachers. The other victim is in depression .

The Vice Chancellor of the reputed uni "Aditya Shastri" is denying the occurrence of any such incident and was unwilling to meet the protesting students.
God knows whether the Indian police will seriously do something at least in this case or not.
