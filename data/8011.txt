Domestic Violence, Murder, Dowry Harassment
Description:
			A woman was allegedly beaten to death by her husband and his family members for dowry at Fataha village of Giridih district late on Saturday evening.

The deceased has been identified by police as Babita Devi (22), daughter of Thakur Das who is a resident of Rajendranagar locality under Giridih muffasil police station.

In an FIR lodged with Hirodih PS on Sunday, the deceased's father said his daughter's marriage was solemnized with Sikandar Das of Hirodih around seven years ago.

"We had fulfilled their demands as much as we could to solemnize her marriage as per Hindu customs. Her husband and his family demanded extra money and other household items. They would assault and torture her if their demands were not met. Our family tried discussing the matter with her in-laws on a number of occasions, but failed. They beat her again on Saturday night. She succumbed to her injuries and died," stated the FIR.

After receiving information, police visited the site and looked into the matter. The body was sent to Giridih sadar hospital for post-mortem.

"Nothing much can be ascertained as we are still investigating the matter. Based on the FIR lodged by the deceased's father and statements given by few other villagers, the possibility of a dowry death cannot be ruled out. According to the FIR, the deceased's father-in-law Arjun Das, mother-in-law Sundari Devi and husband Sikandar Das, are among six members of the family, who jointly committed this heinous crime", said Hitodih in-charge Ranjit Roshan.

"A case of dowry death has been lodged in this regard but none of the accused could be arrested as they are all absconding," said Roshan to TOI.
