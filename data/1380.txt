Rape
Description:
			A 47-year-old woman of Chamagram has accused the district administration of sitting on her rape complaint for over a month now. She alleged a forest official raped her and accused the police of refusing to file her complaint. 

The victim, who helps her husband in his furniture business, came in touch of Jayanta Muhuri, a forest official posted in the same village. A year back, Muhuri was transferred as the beat officer of Chanchal but he kept contact with the victim's family.  The victim's daughter, a Class-XI student, stays at a rented house and studies in Chanchal.
Few days back, when the victim and her husband went to Chanchal to meet their daughter, Muhuri lured her husband to fetch timber at a low cost from the forest and raped her. However, she could not protest fearing public scrutiny.

The same incident recurred when she visited her daughter recently. This time, the victim raised an alarm and Muhuri was roughed up by the locals.
