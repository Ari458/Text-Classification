Murder, Rape
Description:
			A 21-year-old woman was found murdered at an IAS officer's house in East End Apartments, New Ashok Nagar, east Delhi. She worked as a domestic help there. 

The woman's nude body was discovered by the officer's wife who went into her room to check why she hadn't come out to work. Police believe she was sexually assaulted and then strangled. 

Police said the woman was employed as a cook a year ago via a placement agency. She also had to look after the bed-ridden mother of the officer. 

On Thursday, she wasn't spotted anywhere and her phone was found to be switched off. That's when the officer's wife went to her room and found her dead. 

She immediately raised an alarm and informed police. When police arrived, they saw signs of the room being ransacked, though no articles were missing. They suspect the killer locked the room from the inside, gagged her and raped her before strangulating her. 

Police questioned other helps in the house and the driver. By evening, they detained one Girish for questioning after he gave contradictory statements.
