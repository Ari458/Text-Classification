Description:
			A 26-year-old lady traffic constable was manhandled and sexually assaulted by an auto driver in Kalwa.

The constable was manning the traffic near Satara bank when she spotted auto driver Mohammad Rashid Khan flouting rules.

It was around 7.30pm when she saw Khan ferrying four passengers, which is against the rules. She stopped him and started questioning. When she asked him to show her his licence, he started arguing with her and misbehaving. He then grabbed her hand in anger.

The shocked constable then called out to her colleagues who were nearby. They then dragged Khan to the Kalwa police station and lodged a complaint against him.

She has been working as a constable for several years and it's only the auto drivers who behave in an unruly manner. She decided to teach him a lesson when he grabbed her hand. So, she dragged him down to the police station.

DCP Dr Shrikant Paropkari said, "I have heard about the incident. We will deal with the culprit strictly. I have also alerted the cops to take strict action against such persons."
