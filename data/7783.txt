Description:
			A 15-year-old Class 10 school girl committed suicide at her home in Kodungaiyur here on Monday evening as she was upset over being teased by her classmates, police said.

Police identified the deceased as Karthika, daughter of Ravi and Jaya Bharathi. Karthika, who was studying at Sai Vivekananda Vidhayalaya in Kodungaiyur, committed suicide by hanging herself from the ceiling of her house.

Relatives of the girl laid siege to the school on Tuesday demanding action against a group of boys and girls who had teased her. They said a few of her classmates had teased her for no reason and attacked her with a writing pad.
