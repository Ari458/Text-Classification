Abduction
Description:
			A 12-year-old girl, who was working as a domestic help in New Mansa Devi Nagar here and was missing since September 4, has been traced and reunited with her parents, police said today.

The girl was traced to Darbhanga in Bihar and brought here yesterday before being reunited with her parents, they said.

The girl's father Maksoodan Sahni had filed a missing complaint after his daughter, who served as a domestic help in the house of one Kulwinder Kaur in New Mansa Devi Nagar locality, did not return home on September 4.

Sahni, who lives in the same locality, alleged involvement of Kaur and her son Amroop Singh in the kidnapping. A case under IPC Section 363 (kidnapping) was registered against the mother-son duo.

Police received information about the girl being traced to Darbhanga. A team was dispatched to Darbhanga which brought the girl here yesterday. After conducting the girl's medical examination and recording her statement, she was reunited with her parents.

Meanwhile, the girl's parents and supporters had staged a demonstration outside Satnampura police station and then outside the DSP's office last week to protest alleged "inaction" by the police against Kaur and her son.

Phagwara DSP Sukhwinder Singh and Satnampura SHO Inspector Ravinder Singh said police is investigating how the girl reached Bihar and said the accused will be arrested soon.
