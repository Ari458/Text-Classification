Human Trafficking
Description:
			A minor Assamese girl who was allegedly trafficked to Delhi and forced into prostitution has been rescued by police from southeast Delhi's Okhla area.

A woman, identified as Guddi (31), has been arrested for allegedly bringing the girl to the city from Assam on the pretext of finding her a job and then keeping her captive and forcing her into prostitution, police said.

Guddi was arrested from her home in Khanpur after police registered a case under POCSO Act and other relevant sections of the law on the basis of the victim's complaint.

The matter came to light at around 10 P.M. last night after some locals made a PCR call when they found the girl sitting and crying by railway tracks.

A police team brought her to Okhla police station, where she narrated her ordeal. Medical examination of the girl has confirmed rape.

"The girl was brought to Delhi by Guddi a few months back and kept captive at her home in Khanpur.

"She (Guddi) then brought men to her house who raped the girl. Guddi even told her that she had sold her to some other party who would soon take her away to somewhere else," police said.

The girl somehow managed to escape Guddi's clutches yesterday and reached the railway track from where police eventually rescued her.

The girl has been sent to a children's home for counselling and efforts are being made to locate her family.

Police are also looking to nab those who assaulted the girl.
